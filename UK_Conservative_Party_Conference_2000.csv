"1","Andrew Lansley"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-02,"Delivering the Common Sense RevolutionToday I would like to talk to conference about Believing in Britain and how Conservative policies will deliver a common sense revolution for our country. ""My job, as Don said, is to coordinate policy for the Conservatives. And as Shadow Cabinet Office Minister, Mo Mowlam is my opposite number. It is supposed to be her job to coordinate Labour's policies. At least in theory. ""In fact she has been on late night chat shows more often than she has been to the Despatch Box to answer for her Government's policies. But then maybe she knows what we know - that there is no future in the Labour Party. So Mo Mowlam has decided to give up at the next election. Apparently she wants to get involved in conflict resolution. Why on earth is she leaving? ""If that is the case the best place for her is in the Cabinet. Tony's gang versus Gordon's gang. It's like West Side Story but without the music. ""You know, it tells us a lot about this Labour Government, and Mr Blair in particular, that he is prepared to see Mo Mowlam pushed out of his Government by his own people with their briefing and backbiting. ""While, just ten months after Peter Mandelson resigned in disgrace Tony Blair welcomed him back into his Government - That's a disgrace! ""Apparently, that's the action of ""a pretty straight sort of guy"". That is how Mr Blair 'modestly' described himself. Whilst - at the same time - he was denying Labour's intention to take Formula One donations. About as straight as a nine bob note. ""If the people of Britain want to know what it is like, in truth, to have a pretty straight sort of guy for a Prime Minister, they don't have to look far. ""One was on this platform this afternoon - John Major. The other will be on this platform on Thursday - William Hague. ""Now let me tell you a tale about last week's Labour conference. As you came into the hall today, you passed stalls selling Conservative Party stuff, you know - T-shirts, posters, that kind of thing. Of course they do the same thing at the Labour conference. Only this year, Labour went further. They brought out a whole new line of Labour products. ""Books of course. Andrew Rawnsley's Book in the non-fiction section, the Labour Party manifesto in the fiction section, and the Government's Annual Report in the pulped fiction section. ""Then there is the John Prescott thesaurus - when only the wrong word will do. Or what about a Jack Straw burglar alarm - it warns the burglar when the police are coming. Or why not take out a loan for a Peter Mandelson washing machine - goes straight to the spin cycle but never washes whiter. Or could you spare 75 pence for a Gordon Brown kiss me quick hat. ""Then again for the discerning traveller, the Robin Cook travel kit with international adapter - it changes your principles according to which country you're in. ""Mo Mowlam vanishing cream as supplied by Millbank Tower. Or the Tony Blair ""you can't be sure"" antiperspirant. I say, send the Labour products to trading standards. Time for a product recall. ""And it is the Conservative Party's policies that we will put in our shop window this week. In July William Hague led the shadow cabinet in a day long series of discussions to finalise our policy proposals for Believing in Britain. We weren't talking about Labour. We were only interested in what we can achieve, through our policies, for Britain. ""I saw a team which was imaginative and purposeful. We knew that freedom, responsibility, enterprise and choice were key Conservative principles to work from. We had the ideas from the Listening to Britain programme. ""We had common sense practical solutions from meetings with you the party members all over Britain. And Believing in Britain is the result of our work. ""This document doesn't talk about Labour. This document is all about our positive policies. Because we know that Britain needs a new direction. One that is totally different from Labour's. Because they have reverted to the classic Labour mistake. When a little socialism fails they think more socialism is the answer. ""So when tax and waste, red tape, spin, and bossy-boots political correctness has got them nowhere, do they stop? No - they do more of it. ""That is why they have failed and that is why they will fail. It is no good Mr Blair asking for ten years to deliver - if he is going in the wrong direction he will never get there. So, Conservatives will take a new direction. Where will that take us? ""Our new direction will mean a competitive economy. The best place to do business. ""Because taxes are low, burdens are light and Universities that are centres for the knowledge economy which will be critical to our place in global markets. A new direction means realising the potential of every child at school. ""Schools pursuing high standards. Schools genuinely responding to parents' choices and to the needs of every child. Excellent schools, including grammar schools, but with every school free to raise the expectations and achievements of its pupils. ""Schools getting resources directly, free from bureaucracy. Schools able to specialise and adapt the curriculum to meet differing needs. Schools with an ethos of discipline and respect for teachers. ""Our new direction means a health service that treats patients as individuals not numbers. A health service where quality of care is the only measure that counts. A health service where doctors and nurses are free to care for patients as they know best, not as politicians dictate. ""A health service which will be there when people need it with a day and a doctor they can count on: that is our patients guarantee. ""Our new direction also means new life for our cities. Britain's greatest unrealised potential is in our inner cities. Even in London, shameful poverty, unemployment and dereliction is to be found within a few miles of the City of London. ""Big budget government programmes have never got to the heart of the problem, that those with families and a future are too likely to abandon the inner city. ""So we must harness the powers and budgets of central and local government and the enterprise of the private and voluntary sectors. Together we must create safe streets, strong schools and sustainable, thriving communities. ""And our new direction means giving people a sense of security. It will mean more police. It will mean tougher sentences. It will mean a constructive and purposeful prison regime. ""It will mean visible local policing and active community involvement in detecting and combating crime. It will mean the toughest possible measures to protect our children from drug dealers. It will mean Ann Widdecombe as the Home Secretary. There is more in here that we must do. ""But if we can do these things then I for one will be deeply proud. For we will have transformed Britain and its hope for the future. A few minutes ago we saw hundreds of our candidates for the next election. Not one of us will take that election for granted. ""But let me tell you this. I believe that many of those Conservatives will be back. Only next time they will be back as Members of Parliament presenting to you the policies of the next Conservative Government. ""We can be proud of our party, we can be proud of our people and we can be proud of our policies. We have seen bad times and we have learnt from them. ""Listening to Britain has put us back on track with the instincts and experiences of the mainstream majority of this country. The Common Sense Revolution has put us at the forefront of ideas, which will shape government in the future. ""It has been a year of campaigns. We campaigned to keep the pound - and the people of Britain are responding. We voted against petrol tax rises and took our campaign to the people and they responded - some of them in ways we never expected. ""We showed how pensioners could once again be given the respect and dignity they deserve, and they, too, are responding. ""On these, on tackling the asylum crisis, on discipline in schools, on guaranteed waiting times in the NHS, and on enforcing law and order, William Hague has shown how Common Sense can achieve a revolution in government: a government that delivers. ""Every time I hear the Labour party accuse us of populism, I count it a victory. Because what they mean is that we are Listening to Britain. It is Labour who are out of touch. Not just because of the red boxes, official cars and grace and favour apartments. No. It goes much deeper than that. ""It is born out of their arrogant disregard for the people they claim to serve. Mr Blair said he would govern for all the people. ""Let him tell that to the farmers, to manufacturers, to hauliers, to motorists, to small businesses, to hard-working families paying higher taxes, to teachers demoralised by endless form filling, to doctors and nurses told they are getting billions extra but who see none of it. ""Let him tell that to the pensioners who received a one per cent increase in their pensions, while petrol tax went up three per cent, and council tax six per cent. ""No, Mr Blair, no one believes you anymore. Because we know. We know that Labour govern for the few. ""Taxes from the many, spending by the few. Labour are the party of tax and waste and we have to stop it. There are people at home watching this on television - at least I hope you are. Many of them will be thinking that Labour have let them down. They know now that they can't trust Labour. ""The party that said it would be purer than pure has governed through deceit and spin. The party that said it was 'new' has turned out to be the same old Labour. ""The party that said it would not increase taxes at all has forced the people of Britain into a taxpayers revolt because taxes are up and we can't see what we are paying for or where the money is going. ""People know they can't trust Labour. They want to know: can they trust us? We lost their trust. We can win it back. ""We will gain that trust because Listening to Britain is now the way we do business in this Party. We will gain that trust because we will speak for the mainstream majority of our country. We will gain that trust because we will set people free. ""Free to choose because people will keep more of what they earn. Freedom for schools and hospitals to meet the needs of parents and patients. Freedom for local government to choose priorities, and to be the voice for civic pride and community renewal. ""We will gain people's trust because we will give backing to the police to be a strong, visible, local presence to deter and detect crime; and we will hold that trust because we will not allow Britain to be broken up, nor our sovereignty to be transferred to a United States of Europe. ""Trusted because we will deliver value for money, and because we will not spend more than the country can afford. Trusted because we will be the Party of enterprise and cut the burdens of tax, red tape. Trusted because we will give teachers and schools the respect, the freedom and the resources to raise standards. ""Trusted because we will take politics out of the NHS. Trusted because we will keep the pound. Trusted because we will only promise what we know we can deliver. ""Under William's leadership; ""With Conservative principles; ""With Common Sense policies; ""And with an unshakeable belief in Britain and what we can achieve, with your support; ""We can, we must; and we will earn the trust of the people of Britain."
"2","Thomas Strathclyde"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-02,"Lord Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to open this session by thanking all my colleagues in the House of Lords for the work they do. I know of no group of people more committed to our country or our party. Not just those still working there, but all those dedicated, long-serving members so gracelessly tossed out by Margaret Jay last year. ""I know you`ll pay them the tribute they so richly deserve. ""You know - has it ever struck you as strange how New Labour call themselves a 'people`s government.' Yet time and again it`s been the House of Lords that have spoken for the people. ""Jack Straw wanted to curb the ancient English right to trial by jury. We stopped him dead in his tracks. Labour refused to let war widows who remarried keep their pensions. We made them back down. And, of course, it was only the Lords who thwarted Tony Blair`s personal obsession to abolish Section 28 and allow promotion of homosexuality to schoolchildren. ""What a remarkable part Janet Young played in leading that fight. ""You may, though, be wondering where my friends from the Lords are today - well they`re working at Westminster clearing up Labour`s legislative mess. So in their absence can I pay tribute to members of my front bench team especially Oliver Henley the Chief Whip and John Mackay, my deputy. Can I also thank Christopher Fraser my PPS who bears the brunt of communicating with our colleagues in the Commons? And in welcoming Angela Browning as the new Opposition Leader of the Commons, can I thank her predecessor, Sir George Young who has given such unstinting service to the Conservative Party, and personal support to me. ""New Labour has given our great old country some heavy blows. Tony Blair and his friends - those titans of management who masterminded the triumph of the Millennium Dome - turned to their next trick. They took our constitution, evolved over the wisdom of centuries, and tore it to shreds. They hadn`t time for anything that might stand in their way. They set out with one aim in mind - to throw over the old checks and balances, belittle our Parliament, hand its responsibilities to others, but making sure all along that No.10 had a handle on everything. ""Yes - you can have a Welsh Assembly, so long as Tony`s boyo`s in charge. Yes - you can have a Mayor of London, so long as it`s Tony`s man. Yes - you can even keep a House of Lords, so long as it`s full of Tony`s friends. The Project wasn`t about principle. It was about power, peppered with a corrosive hatred of everything that was part of the old British constitution. Beginning with Parliament. ""The Prime Minister doesn`t care about Parliament. He doesn`t answer to Parliament. He rarely even goes to Parliament. That`s why he`s been so free and easy with handing the responsibilities of Parliament to others. That`s why he`s undermined the supremacy of Parliament and increasingly put us under politically correct judges sitting in Europe. That`s why, purring like a tame kitten, he`s handed over powers that Tory governments fought like tigers to keep in British hands. ""Whoever thought we would see the day when jobsworths in Town Halls were hounding traders for selling fruit to pensioners in pounds and ounces, while fat-cat lawyers were rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of the Human Rights bonanza coming their way? ""That`s the shameful reality of Blair`s Brave New Britain. ""Labour`s assault and battery on the constitution has been a monumental disaster. It makes the Dome look like a triumph of planning and foresight. But the sad thing is, it`s far, far more important. And it`ll take a far longer time to put right. You can`t solve the problems of a constitution by flying in a Frenchman from Disneyland. ""When we form a government we will have to build anew what Labour have so capriciously destroyed. Some things, like Scotland`s new Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, we will continue to support. Tony Blair`s failed attempts at fixes from London, crippled the new bodies from the outset. Scotland and Wales need grown-up politics again. And with more Scottish and Welsh Conservatives, these bodies will work better. In whatever we do we will never give up trying to hold our country together. ""For Conservatives - only Conservatives - truly believe in the Union. One United Kingdom. And in defence of the Union - I promise you - this Conservative and Unionist Party will always stand firm. ""Other things we will reject out of hand. We will make no shabby deals with those Liberal Democrats. We won`t go cap in hand, like Tony Blair, to the Ashdowns and Kennedys, begging their permission to do what`s right for Britain. PR would mean a permanent stranglehold on power for the Liberal lunatic fringe. We will never, ever agree to PR for Westminster. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, no part of our constitution has been more brutally vandalised than the House of Lords. To act - as it should - as a check on government - To protect us - as only it can - from badly drafted law - it must be independent of any government. That`s the difference between the parties. We want a strong and independent House of Lords in a strong Parliament. Tony Blair wants a weak and submissive House of Lords in a weak Parliament. Tony Blair wants a House of Lords that makes it easier for Tony Blair to get his way. A House he can treat just as arrogantly as he does the Commons. A House that knows its place, a House that`s seen and not heard, a House he can safely ignore. ""So let me be clear. We reject totally the idea of any further reduction in the powers of the Lords. Indeed, it should do more. We should, where necessary, throw out some of the crazy regulations that increasingly dominate our lives. We should set up a constitutional Committee in the Lords to act as a watchdog on ill-thought out change. And we want a House of independent minds and real authority. That`s why we`re likely to want more elected peers than proposed by the Royal Commission - and certainly more than Labour would ever dream of giving. ""But ideally we believe that further reform should be achieved by consensus, by wide-ranging discussions, free to consider composition as well. That ought to come now in a Joint committee of both Houses of Parliament. Surely it is there in Parliament that the future of Parliament should be decided - not backstairs in No.10 or in the backrooms of the Labour Party Conference. That is what we ask of the government. ""You don`t need a crystal ball to imagine what Tony Blair`s ideal House would be. We can see it in the making. Month after month in the Lords we see new appointees complain the hours are too long, They have to be there to vote when the curtain`s up or the restaurant`s closing. They can`t use Parliament as a modern business centre. They don`t get paid. We`ve seen distinguished public servants and war veterans ousted to make way for celebrity favourites, pop barons and wives of friends. Sometimes it`s as though we`re in the Dome. There`s the Crony zone, The Flatmate zone and even New Labour`s money zone. ""In three years Tony Blair has created as many peers as Margaret Thatcher did in eleven. He`s the uncrowned King of Ermine. If only his record on health, schools, crime or pensions was a fraction as good. ""75 pence a week for the pensioners who made our country. What an insult when a Blair peer digs in the ratepayers` pockets for £300 a 9 week for taxi fares alone. When Tony Blair`s literary hero Melvyn Bragg has sat scarcely two years in the Lords before he`s demanding £10,000 a year for the privilege. £10,000? Is he so hard up? Surely one television programme most of Tony`s crony peers wouldn`t need to go on is ""Who wants to be a Millionaire?"" For most of them the millionaires are the people buying the smaller houses down the hill. ""I don`t want to knock them all. Think of the contribution Lord Falconer has made. Charlie to his friends - a right Charlie to the taxpayers. Frankly, if he had a sense of honour he would have gone, long ago. ""When I compare the dignified and impeccable behaviour of Lord Carrington at the time of the Falklands, then I say to myself the old House of Lords could teach Tony Blair`s friends a lesson or two. ""Tony Blair said that the Dome was going to be the first line of the next Labour manifesto. Well if that`s the first line I can`t wait to see the rest! ""You`ll find seams of British decency yards deep among old Labour voters up and down this land. People who`ve given a lifetime of service to Britain - in hospitals, in the factories, in schools or in the home, bringing up their children with values that stretch back for generations. They must be staggered to find their party has been hijacked by a politically correct agenda, run by the Islington few. And that`s why they`re turning away from Labour. ""But now the Prime Minister tells us they`re listening again. They even say they`re listening to the countryside - but, as usual, John Prescott`s the last to get the message. And who exactly has emerged as the key link between Labour and the countryside? None other than Margaret Jay. Apparently, she has a little cottage in the countryside which she visits most weekends. That must make struggling farmers and desperate rural motorists feel a whole lot better. It`s a bit like saying Peter Mandelson understands poverty in inner cities because he lived in a £700,000 flat in Notting Hill. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, you have to laugh. Or you would have to cry out in anger at what these people have made of our country. But don`t despair. The clock is running out on New Labour. It was a late `90s fad. And it`s fast becoming yesterday`s fashion. ""It will fall to us to rebuild our constitution and strengthen our Parliament. As we do, we will defend this country`s democratic inheritance, our national sovereignty, the rights of individuals and the unique character of these islands. We want to see a second chamber not rivalling the Commons but strengthening the place of parliament in our nation`s life. Parliament doesn`t belong to a particular political party. Its job is not to flatter ministers but to question, to probe, to hold to account, to be the nation`s voice. And we will listen to Parliament in a way this government never has. ""And that is our pledge to you. To return Parliament to centre stage in our national life. But until that day comes, we will stand firm, in Parliament, and for Parliament. For the rights of Parliament are the rights of the people. They are the freedoms our forbears fought for. We believe in Parliament. Our nation`s Parliament. And we shall not allow Tony Blair to trash the authority of that Parliament, which so many generations of British people battled, to build."
"3","Michael Ancram"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-02,"Call Election NowThis is the Conference which I believe with all my heart can set us on the road to victory at the General Election.""One of the most sickening sights at Brighton last week was Blair and Brown praising themselves for having given Britain a strong economy. Let's get one thing absolutely straight right at the start.""They inherited from us in 1997 inflation at a 30 year low.  They inherited the fastest growth and the lowest taxes in Europe.  They inherited the most rapid falls in unemployment anywhere in the European Union.""And it wasn't Tony or Gordon who achieved our strong economy.""That golden legacy was a Conservative achievement delivered by John Major. And what a pleasure it is to see John and Norma here with us today.  This Conference will be about winning.  We know we can win, because over this last year we have won time and time again.""And we come to this conference with our opponents in disarray, their cover blown, their image shattered and their hollowness exposed.""I would like personally to thank those who work with me at Central Office.  David Prior and John Taylor.  Tim Collins, Nigel Evans, Steve Norris and my PPS Stephen O'Brien.  Rick Nye, Amanda Platell and Stephen Gilbert and all our professional staff.  To them all my heartfelt thanks.""But my greatest thanks go out to all of you.""You are the troops who through rain and shine take to the streets to deliver the message, to convert the doubters and to bring in the vote.""We may plan.  You deliver.  We may direct the battle.  You fight it and you win it.  Since we last met there have been many battles and many victories.""You have defied the political pundits.  In fact I think of you as the ""Pundit-Busters"".  600 'pundit-busting' gains at the local elections.""A staggering 'pundit-busting' first place in the London Assembly elections and a strong second place for mayor.  And every week a constant stream of 'pundit-defying' local by-election gains.""These are your victories which have turned the tide and I thank you for them.  And now the opinion polls are showing what we have known for some months.  The rigid political mould of the last eight years is broken.  Now there is all to play for.  We know, and more importantly so do our opponents, that we can win.""It has not all been plain sailing.  We lost Romsey.  But on the same night we blew the Liberal Democrats away in many of their heartlands.  So let me give Charles Kennedy due notice.  We will take Romsey back.  And along with it we are determined to take back more than 30 of your seats.  From Cornwall to Colchester, from Torbay to Twickenham, from Somerset to Southport we will take you on and we will beat you.""Two weeks ago Kennedy proclaimed that his party was ""in touch with the British people"".Don't kid yourself, Charlie.  Not on scrapping the Pound nor on putting up petrol taxes, you ain't.  Nor on anything much else.  The only person Chat Show Charlie is really in touch with is Mr Blair, plotting pacts and coalition.""He has reduced his once great national Party to a mere faction within the politics of the left, supine in the face of New Labour, and grovelling for political crumbs.""Liberal Democrats may still be the dirtiest fighters in British politics. But so rank is their hypocrisy, so naked their cynical ambition that this time nothing will save them from the justified contempt of the British people.""No wonder Kennedy describes us as the enemy. We are indeed. An implacable enemy that will not rest until we have driven his party from the seats they took from us.""So we come to this conference believing in ourselves and believing we can win.  We have spent these last years building a formidable political machine.  We are ready for the fight.""Last week Mr Blair told us that he too was ready for the fight, that he relished the fight.  Well, I have a challenge for him.""If these words are more than mere rhetoric, if he is so certain of his so-called mission, so confident that he has got it right, then let him call the election now.""Let him emerge from the shelter of his spin-doctors' nests.  Let him agree to debate face to face on television with William Hague during the election.  And then let the people judge.""Or was all of his brave speech last week just another cynical regurgitation of Spin?We are ready to let the people decide.  Are you, Mr Blair?  Are you?""Last week in Brighton the Labour Party talked a lot about us.  They attacked us, they vilified us, they challenged us.  Well this week we are going to talk a lot about - us as well.  And for the same reason. Over these last months we have established ourselves as a genuine government in waiting - and Labour know it.  I don't mind their attacks.  I welcome them.""Because every lie and every insult tells me that they believe we can win, and that they are running scared.  This week will show how right they are to be scared of us. Where we have vision they have lost their way.  Where we have new ideas they have only tired undeliverable promises.  Where we have answers they have only empty gestures.""This is our chance to show that far from the shores of extremism upon which our opponents seek to place us we are the party of the mainstream sharing the values of the mainstream majority in this country.""We believe in the family.  So do the mainstream.We believe in doing the right thing.  So do the mainstream.We believe in less government doing more and doing it better.  So do the mainstream.We believe in Britain.  And so, thank goodness, do the mainstream too.""This then is our chance to show that we have genuinely listened and continue to listen to the British people, that we understand their concerns.  And that we are responding with common sense policies which go to the heart of those concerns and which can be delivered to every family in the land.  We will show that we understand the very real fears of people who are ill but cannot get the treatment they need at the time they need it. For them we can and will provide the assurance of a day and a doctor they can count on.""We will show that we understand the very real concerns of the mother who believes that the education system is letting her child down but feels powerless to do anything about it.  Or the young dedicated teacher who just wants to teach but finds herself constantly undermined by a mixture of indiscipline and the weight of bureaucracy. That is why we are committed to giving greater freedom to schools, to reducing regulations on teachers and giving all parents more choice.""We will demonstrate that we share the very real fear of the young and the old who feel vulnerable to the increasing violence in our society today.  We will put victims first and we will make sure that the law does too.""We will show too that we share the anger of so many hardworking families whose standard of living is being eroded by stealth taxes, not least the tax on fuel.  We will demonstrate that we will be a government of lower taxes while maintaining the quality of public services.""We will show that we respect the dignity of the pensioner by recognising their right to choose their own priorities in how they spend their pensions and by providing more for them to do so.""We will show that we recognise the problems of the countryside.  John Prescott may contemptuously deride those who fight for their village schools and shops, their jobs and their way of life - what he calls ""contorted faces"".  Let me tell him what has contorted those faces.Living under a government that doesn't understand the countryside, doesn't care about the countryside and can't be trusted with the countryside.  And at the next election the countryside will repay his contempt with interest - by kicking Labour out.""And we will demonstrate that we - just as the Danes - mind about our currency, which is why we will fight tooth and nail at the next Election to keep the Pound.  And we will prove that we mind about our country.""That in the face of the nationalist challenge from within we remain the Party of the Union and that at the next election we will fight to defend our nation's unity.""And what is more within a devolved United Kingdom, I tell you that we will do what Mr Blair refuses point-blank to do - we will restore fairness to England. We will show too that we are now the only major party that believes in Britain, a Britain in Europe but not run by Europe.  Blair and Brown may pretend otherwise.  But they are preparing already in the months ahead to surrender more of our rights of self-determination and to move us further down the slippery slope towards a European Superstate.  We give notice again today that we can never accept that.  Nor will the British people.  And we will fight it with all the strength at our disposal.""This then is the programme of a Party which is prepared for government and of a team which is more than a match for the other side; for a start because it is a team!""Contrast that with Mr Blair's napoleonic self-delusion last week that he alone can lead his party and the country to the Promised Land.  And see this week the reality dawn.""Blair knows now for the first time that he can lose.  And he knows now for the first time that we can win.  ""Just remember where he and his cabinet began three and a half years ago with the golden economic legacy inherited from John Major, with massive public goodwill, with an unassailable parliamentary majority and with a fair political wind behind them.   And they've blown it all!""They`ve squandered the economic legacy.   So much money spent, so much money wasted, and what have they got to show for it?  The Health Service deteriorating.  Schools under greater pressure. Transport at a standstill.  Crime rising and police numbers falling.  Taxes going up.  And nothing delivered.  They've blown the goodwill by failing to keep the promises they so cynically made.  And instead of apologising they have just made a whole lot more!""They have devalued the integrity of politics by Spin and lies and distortions until nobody believes the words any more.  And they have spilled the political wind because when the storms came they showed they were incapable of handling them.""Blair's own reaction to crisis is revealing, as we saw in the face of the fuel protest last month.  His first reaction was to go into hiding, sending out pathetic sidekicks like John Reid to take the flak for him.  Then to emerge briefly from his bunker to blame everyone except himself.  And finally with mind-blowing arrogance to deride the genuine anger of the vast majority of the British people.""That week of crisis showed all that is and always has been wrong with Blair and with New Labour.  It showed that they don't listen.  It showed the only answer they have is spin.  It showed that in the face of pressure they are incompetent.  It showed that in the face of public hostility they are frightened.  It showed that when they are cornered they will always try to lie their way out.""And it showed above all that mixture of arrogance and insecurity which is the hallmark of the bully through the ages.  And the British people saw it all too clearly.""I put no great store by opinion polls.  They are snapshots.  But these recent snapshots of the last few weeks show if nothing else that the magic of the mirage that was New Labour has gone, and gone forever.""It didn't just happen in these last weeks.  It began at the turn of the year and it began where-else but in the Dome.  The Millennium Dome.  What a corrupt and incompetent mess.  What an enormous waste of money. Glitz on the outside, nothing much worthwhile on the inside, and not even designed to last.  And we are told it can't be closed yet because it's saving jobs.  Well one job, certainly. Lord Falconer's!""But there's another Dome, another Big Tent, glitz on the outside, nothing worthwhile inside, very expensive and not designed to last.  It's called the Blair Dome - sometimes referred to as the Government.  It also has halls and zones.""The Hall of Blame - with huge blow-up pictures of the Cabinet under a signsaying: 'don't blame me, nobody told me what was going on'.""The Wall of Love- covered in graffiti - Gordon loves Tony - Mandy loves Gordon - Prescott loves Mandy and Gordon - and at least one that's true - Robin loves Robin.  And as background music the sound of sharpening knives.""And then the Zones:""The Promises Zone - full.  The Delivery Zone - empty.  The Truth Zone - completely empty.""And at the very centre the Listening Zone - with a giant statue of Blair surrounded by a bank of TV screens all showing Alistair Campbell's face saying, "" Don't listen to them, Tony.  Take it from me; you're perfect.""  Two Domes: both going down the tubes.  With one difference.   The Millennium Dome can hardly be accused of causing queues!""But at least with the fuel crisis Blair actually fulfilled a promise at last.  He always said he'd get the country back on its feet!  We have to win the election.  There is too much at stake to lose.""Our cause is about believing in Britain, in all its diversity and in all its aspects.""I like many in our party came into politics because I believe in my country, because I believe in a society where it is worth doing the right thing.""Where people matter as individuals with their own hopes and fears.""Where decency and standards and ethics count for something.  And I see all these being threatened by a Government which doesn't understand them.  Our fight is to preserve them.""That doesn't mean that Britain hasn't changed and cannot change.  It has and it must, as indeed we must and we have too.  But that change must build on values which are instinctively ours.  It must remould them for a new century and a new generation.""We look forward to a government which will stand up for the hard working family, which will stand up for every child and every pensioner and every person striving to make the most of their opportunities.""We look forward to a Britain where proclaiming our ambition for our country will never again be described as extreme, where supporting the family will never again be attacked as extreme, where fighting for justice will never again be pilloried as extreme.""A Britain based on freedom, on opportunity, on pride.  A Britain which is good to live in, good to do business in and is still the best country in the world. These are our political beliefs and our vision.  And Blair despises them.  He and his government have set the distinctions and defined the choices.  The real choice is very simple. You can vote for Britain or you can vote for Blair, but you can't vote for both.""The fight ahead will be hard and it will be long.  I can offer no easy passage.  We must be disciplined and united in our determination to win. It will need courage. It will need resilience.  It will need determination. It will need vision.  It will need integrity.  And above all it will need strength.  And we have all these - in one person - in our leader William Hague.""William, we have watched you in the difficult years when however hard the going you never once wavered, never once flinched, never lost heart and never let hold of the flame.  You have kept us going.""Now you will lead us in this great drive to win the general election.  And we will serve you with pride.""These last three years have not been easy.  They have been gruelling. They have been wearing. They have often been dark. But there is today a new dawn lighting the horizon.  It is the reawakening within our country of the spirit of reality, of generosity, of choice, of freedom.  It is the renewing of our party and of our dream.""Our task is daunting.  Our goal is worthy.  Our cause is Britain.""Let us go on from here - and win."
"4","Michael Portillo"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-03,"Four years ago Tony Blair promised us a new Britain. He promised taxes wouldn't rise. But they have. He promised shorter waiting lists. But they're longer. He promised smaller classes. But they're larger. He promised more police. But there are fewer. He promised his government would be purer than pure. What a joke. I feel so sorry for the many people who put their hopes in that man. They are so bitterly disappointed. They were sold a dream and it's just not there. And there hasn't been a single word of apology. Well, he did say the Dome hadn't been a runaway success. Not a runaway success? As I recall, that's what people said to me after my defeat in Enfield Southgate. It's four years since I could address a party conference from the platform. A lot of water has flowed under the bridge. We've travelled a long distance since then: I have, you have, the party has. I was devastated by my defeat at the time. It certainly didn't feel like it at the time, but the British electorate did me a favour. My period out of parliament was a chance to connect with the Britain of today. Now, as Shadow Chancellor, I cannot forget those experiences. My job is not just about dry economics. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. We are the party that understands how much the world has changed. Our country would be stronger and its people more willing to take responsibility if we had fewer politicians passing fewer laws, raising fewer taxes and intruding less in our lives. Young people reject the Labour Party's bossiness, meddling, banning and regulating. Britain has changed and the Conservatives have changed with it. For new generations of British people, old prejudices have been swept away. The Conservative Party is a party for our times. We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity. That Britain was on display in Sydney. Athletes of every background united by a pride in Britain, and Britain united by its pride in them. Conservatives don't look for uniformity, but for the qualities that mark people out as individual and exceptional. We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative Party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect. Why should people respect us if we withhold respect from them? We value people for what's inside them. We heard last week Labour's smears against our policy on asylum seekers. That policy will re-establish public confidence in our controls. That frees us to give a warm welcome to those who come to Britain in fear of their lives. That's how my father came. Britain's willingness to take in refugees defines us as a generous and responsible people. It's a tradition that will be upheld by the Conservative Party. We want people to aspire, to reach the heights to which their qualities can lift them. While I was out of parliament I took a television camera into some housing estates. I saw a lot of poverty. But in a way what shocked me was not so much the absolute poverty - for many people had videos and their children wore Reebok trainers. What distressed me most was the poverty of expectation and ambition, the lack of hope for anything better in life to come. But in a Saturday school organised by the black community in Sandwell, I found that aspiration: parents determined that their children should have a chance to fulfil their dreams. And education would be the ladder by which they'd climb. Many Labour politicians climbed that ladder. But now they want to kick it away from others. For reasons of pure dogma, they destroy good schools: grant-maintained schools and grammar schools. But they send their own children to exclusive schools. That's Labour's real policy on education. One rule for themselves, another rule for those they govern. William Hague went to a state school. So did Theresa May. So did I. I had excellent teachers. We weren't intimidated by public schools like Mr Blair's. We thought we could do just as well as they did. No state school should ever feel second class. Every parent knows that a school is only as good as its head teacher. The Conservative way is to trust the head teachers and give them the money to spend as they choose. We will give them the opportunity to create great schools, to lift the sights of their pupils, and to transform their young lives. This is our message to parents and teachers: we will set the schools free. The next generation will want to be more independent in their retirement than pensioners are today. We will give them the chance to put their money into a properly-funded pension. We'll enable future generations to accrue prosperity and share fully in the growth of our economy. We won't fudge welfare reform. Gordon Brown promised pensioners change. They got it. Loose change. 75 pence. And when pensioners sent it back in disgust, Gordon cashed the cheques. While I was enjoying my sabbatical, I worked for a few shifts as a hospital porter. I remember once wheeling a patient to the operating theatre on a trolley. He was motionless and I was awfully afraid he might be dead. But without warning, almost like Frankenstein's monster he sat bolt upright and said, ""What on earth are you doing here Mr Portillo?"" I was experiencing the sharp end of the NHS. Everything was in short supply. There weren't enough wheel chairs. So porters had to horde them. It reminded me of stories of the war, when there was rationing, but everyone mucked in and tried to be cheerful. It was impressive. The doctors, nurses - and porters - are heroes. But things shouldn't have to be like that. Britain spends too little on health. There's a consensus amongst the parties that we should spend much more money on the NHS. But not on how to spend it, nor on how that money can be supplemented. Labour impose politically motivated targets on our doctors and nurses. No wonder they're demoralised. We would give doctors responsibility, and trust them to spend the money wisely, treating the sickest patients first. Where Labour's horizons end, ours begin. Our neighbours in Europe know that you cannot rely on taxes alone to finance health. They would think it silly that families in Britain are encouraged to spend money on their home, on their continued education and on their retirement, but are discouraged through dogma from spending their own money on their health. So other countries have schemes, for instance organised by trade unions and employers. We'll want to encourage that in Britain too. Well spend much more money on the Health Service. And attract extra money too. Labour are stuck in ancient ideology. As Ann Widdecombe once said, Labour have built a Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors. We will tear down that wall. Liberal Democrats have a policy for health and education too. It's is to make doctors and teachers pay more tax. It's not much of a gift for the NHS. But it's a great gift for every Conservative candidate fighting a Liberal Democrat. Let's hear a round of applause for my old pal Charles Kennedy, the Tory candidate's friend. While I was out of Parliament, I became a small business. The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise sent me a pile of forms and books and tables that thick. I found it daunting and time-wasting. What a pity Gordon Brown doesn't live in the real world where business people live. We never forget that governments don't create prosperity. Businesses do. Tomorrow David Heathcoat Amory will tell you about our plans to cut red tape. We will make VAT simpler and fairer. Let's stop punishing the people who create the jobs. All Labour Chancellors regulate more. All Labour Chancellors tax more. But Gordon Brown is no socialist hero. He hasn't taxed the rich to give to the poor. He's cynically chosen soft targets for his stealth taxes: hard-working families, people he thought who would never protest. Labour think high taxes give them the moral high ground. They talk of social justice. They believe that money that government spends is always more worthwhile than money that people spend for themselves on their families. But I don't. I believe in allowing hardworking families to keep more of the money they have earned. I believe in allowing them to keep more of their dignity and responsibility. Recently, a man wrote to me, a member of the seamen's union. The union's told him Gordon Brown's taxed the pension fund and he must pay out another £200 a year if he's not to be worse off in his retirement. Is that social justice? Another man told me he's just retiring. Gordon Brown's abolished the married couple's allowance and age allowance. The man will have to pay £500 a year more in tax than his brother who retired last year. Is that social justice? In Suffolk last week a mother of four children, a beautician, told me she's been driven out of business by Gordon Brown. She can't afford to fill her tank with the most expensive petrol in Europe. Call that social justice, Mr Brown? There is no social justice in high taxation. The Prime Minister devoted a large part of his Brighton speech to smearing the Conservatives. People long ago stopped believing Mr Blair when he spins his own policies let alone when he falsifies ours. People found his speech not only unbelievable but also disillusioning. Wasn't he meant to bring a new honesty to politics? Why can't he behave like a Prime Minister? Before the election Labour claimed it was no longer addicted to high public spending, that the amount we spend is less important than how well we spend it. They committed themselves to stick to Conservative spending plans, because they knew that our prudence was a foundation of economic stability. But as the events of the last few weeks have shown, this is not a Chancellor whose word is his bond. Our economy has been growing since 1992. That gives us an opportunity to increase public spending. I plan to spend more on public services in every year than Labour has spent in any year. But I don't intend to spend money the country hasn't earned. I will leave room for tax cuts. Labour taxes more and delivers less, and plans higher taxes year after year. Conservatives will tax less, spend better and deliver more. That will be the choice at the next election. We will cut taxes on business, so that they can compete and create prosperity and jobs. We will reform Labour's taxes on entrepreneurs and on inward investment. We will encourage savings, to give people security and self-esteem. We will help pensioners and hard-working families. We will restore a married couple's allowance. We will cut the duty on fuel. That gives you a flavour of my budgets! We will keep an independent Bank of England. We will make it more independent of government and more accountable to Parliament. We will establish a National Accounts Commission to show the world that under the Conservatives there will be no fiddled figures. And we will have an independent committee of economists to give public advice to me on the proper level of surplus or deficit. These measures will ensure honesty, transparency and prudence. They will ensure stable economic policies. They will protect the value of the pound in your pocket. And when I say the pound I mean the pound. For our economic policy will be based on Britain having its own currency and setting its own interest rates. Gordon Brown wants to be the next Chancellor of the Exchequer and he can't tell you whether he wants to control his own currency or not. Labour like to call us little Englanders. Is it likely a little Englander would be called Portillo? I am half Spanish, and proud of it. I am a true European, someone with a love of Europe's different cultures. As the Spanish proverb goes: Antes de que te cases, mira lo que haces. Before you get yourself hitched, watch what you're doing. Look before you leap. The euro plan fails to respect Europe's differences. It shoe horns all the economies of Europe, with their different qualities and cycles and stages of development, into just one currency, and just one interest rate. It threatens to take Europe back to boom and bust. The Irish now have high inflation. But there's nothing they can do about it. When Ireland joined the euro it gave up the right to set its own interest rates. In Germany the economy seems to be faltering. For Germany the single European interest rate is too high. Not surprisingly, one interest rate for all of Europe is wrong for most places most of the time. And here's the rub. Supposing the people of Ireland want to vote against the policies that are driving up their prices? They can't do it. Their elected government doesn't make the policy. The critical political decisions about growth and jobs in Ireland are being taken by the European Central Bank. And who votes for the European Central Bank? No one. It's wholly unaccountable. The most precious thing in Europe is democracy. Mr Blair hoped to bamboozle Britain into joining the euro. He hoped to scare us like children with tales of how frightening it would be to be left out. Denmark has shown that people cannot be fooled or bullied by arrogant politicians. Mr Blair please take note. At the election we will oppose the euro. British public opinion is suspicious of the euro as an unproven piece of political dogma. That is our view. That is the view of the moderate majority. We want to keep the pound. And remember this. The euro is a bright idea recommended by the people who brought us the Dome! Labour is leading Britain in the wrong direction. Compared with the United States we are under-performing. Labour is weighing us down with regulations and taxes. It's making us uncompetitive. It'll throw away our national goal of full employment. Last week Tony Blair talked about Britain in his usual cool Britannia terms. In reality Labour lack confidence in Britain and seem ashamed of it. They are defeatist, thinking there's no future for us unless we are more and more absorbed into Europe, less and less able to make choices for ourselves. It's amazing that the government of the world's fourth largest economy should have given up the game. Conservatives recognise the need for Britain to be globally competitive and produce global companies. If we commit ourselves to maintain control of our own currency and taxes, to be agile and open to change, to cut regulation and make our taxes competitive with the world, we can make Britain the outstanding enterprise centre in Europe. We have a vision that fits our times. William Hague has led this party out of dark days. I have never seen anyone face difficulty with such composure. He has real courage. The courage Britain needs in its next Prime Minister. The quality of British life cannot be measured in material terms alone. I will not forget the experiences I had while out of parliament. We will be the party of tax cuts, and welfare reform. Of social justice and full employment. We will use the months ahead to be ready for government, to win the trust of the people that Labour has betrayed. We are a party that believes in Britain, a party for all our people, a party that offers them aspiration and hope."
"5","Iain Duncan Smith"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-03,"Last week the Prime Minister said he had reached his irreducible core. We may not know what his irreducible core is - only his focus groups can tell him that - but we do know that he has reached it. The question is what does he do now he has reached it. I always thought that once you had finished eating an apple you threw away the core. ""Today's debate is not about the Prime Minister's core, but about what his Government has done to the Armed Forces and how we will rectify that. ""We are proud of our Armed Forces. We only need to look at the rescue of the British Army hostages in Sierra Leone to see how good they are. We are proud of their outstanding success. Yet it was not without loss. I would like to pay tribute today to all those who took part, particularly Bombardier Brad Tinnion who gave his life fighting for his comrades and his country. ""Yet behind the headlines, in the Gulf our RAF pilots are fired upon nearly every day by the Iraqis. And in Kosovo and Bosnia our forces patrol an uneasy peace with calm assurance. And last week the Navy came to the rescue of the victims of the Greek ferry disaster. ""Still in Northern Ireland our troops stand in support of the brave men and women of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Let me say that again, Royal Ulster Constabulary. ""Peter Mandelson says that the name conjures up the wrong image. This should come as no surprise from someone who has called our own troops 'chinless wonders' But for me RUC stands for dedication, service and sacrifice. ""In many other areas around the globe they are the unsung heroes. But the armed forces are leaving in droves. Do you blame them? ""Exercises are cancelled, soldiers are being sent into action with guns that don't work, whilst having to use mobile phones on the battlefield, upgraded bombers that can't drop bombs and short of enough pilots to fly them anyway. ""Fighter jets that won't have guns, ships without missiles, sailors shouting 'bang' in gunnery training instead of firing live ammunition. And service families living in sub-standard accommodation for too long. ""Conference, a few weeks ago, people couldn't get fuel for their cars. Well at the end of last year Navy ships were unable to leave port because they couldn't even afford the fuel. ""The result is that the Armed Forces have 5,000 fewer servicemen and women than they did when we left office. That's the equivalent of 10 Army battalions. Or 20 destroyer crews. ""Last week the Prime Minister pompously talked about difficult choices. What he didn't say was that because of cuts, the RAF has to choose either to scrap its Tornadoes or Jaguars. ""This, ladies and gentlemen, is defence of the realm - Labour style. ""Yet today Robin Cook struts his stuff on the world stage, only too happy to commit our overstretched forces everywhere and anywhere. The Armed Forces are the best in the world. But the truth is that behind the gloss, they are being really hurt - yet despite that they show dedication and professionalism in marked contrast to this Government. But whilst they squabble, new threats around the world are emerging. ""We are seeing a dangerous and widespread proliferation of long-range missiles, biological, chemical and even nuclear weapons taking place amongst the rogue states of the world. Missiles are now capable of reaching from the Middle East right to the heart of Europe. It won't be long before they are able to strike here. ""The Americans are responding to this new threat, developing anti-missile systems to defeat this new danger. But instead of supporting our American allies, Mr Blair has run away from the problem and instead is playing games with his plans for a Euro Army. ""The Blair Government has led the creation of a Euro Army to rival NATO, and the EU is busy creating what Mr Prodi has confirmed is a European Army of some 200,000 men. Blair's short-sighted short-term use of Defence as a bargaining chip in the corridors of power in Brussels has risked all our security. ""A Conservative Government will support the Americans in their development of defences against weapons of mass destruction. And we will put paid to any divisive and political notion of a Euro Army. We want to improve European defence capabilities - but within NATO, never outside it. ""But even worse, Labour believes that the Armed Forces are a social experiment in human rights. But what they don't understand is that being a member of the armed forces isn't about rights. They give up many of their rights to defend ours. They are expected if necessary to kill or be killed - events just a few weeks ago in Sierra Leone are a stark reminder of this fact. ""Yet by applying the European Convention on Human Rights to our forces this Government is putting their effectiveness into the hands of campaign junkies, jobbing lawyers and even judges. Theirs is a creeping tide of political correctness threatening to overwhelm our forces' military effectiveness. ""So when we return to Government we will take the Armed Forces out of this politically correct morass, safeguard their unique ethos, and uphold the primacy of military effectiveness. ""Labour's policy of asking the forces to do more with less has damaged all three services. Labour's cut of 18,000 men from the Territorial Army was vindictive. Less than a year after the cut was made they were getting ready to call them up for service in Kosovo. ""In Government, I promise we will return the Territorial Army to its full effectiveness and restore their important place in support of our regulars. The Army is overstretched and 8,000 men understrength. Full manning will be a priority for a Conservative Government. ""We also appreciate and value the dedication and loyalty of service families. And they will be at the centre of our thinking and our policy making. ""For us defence of the realm is the first consideration of any Government. Some people say defence doesn't matter but sixty years ago what Churchill referred to as that brilliant youth risked all in the skies above in the defence of their country and the people they loved. ""My father was one of those few. And he never ceased to tell me the reason so many of his friends died was because politicians had failed to heed the warnings and left us without strong defence. But then this Government doesn't like history …… ""It's a Government which seems to hate the country it was elected to govern, which sets one part of the country against the other. That pours hundreds of millions of pounds into a shapeless piece of foreign plastic, which no one wanted, whilst insulting pensioners and service families. ""But what we understand is that no country ever created a future by making war on its past. ""At the election there will be a choice between spin and substance, between being embarrassed about our nation and being ambitious for our nation. ""Confident and united at last behind William Hague, ours will not be a battle just for Government but for the heart and soul of the country that we love."""
"6","Theresa May"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-03,"Thank you Chairman and I am delighted Ladies and Gentlemen to respond to this excellent debate on Education so very ably introduced by Marion Rix and John Harthman. ""The quality of contributions we have heard this morning shows the importance this Party attaches to the education of all this country`s children. ""Children have only one chance in their school education. If they are to develop their full potential, we must ensure they and their teachers have the freedom to be creative, the inspiration to achieve and the aspiration to be the best. That is our task and I am privileged to be part of it. ""Joining me I have an excellent team. In the House of Commons, Tim Boswell, James Clappison, John Hayes and Geoffrey Clifton Brown; in the European Parliament Philip Bushill-Matthews and in the House of Lords, Emily Blatch, Doreen Miller and Joan Seccombe - ""girl power"" and haven`t they down a magnificent job in winning votes against the Government to defend grammar schools and keep Section 28. ""And joining us on the platform is Cllr Peter Chalke Leader of Wiltshire and our spokesman on education at the LGA -and thank you Peter to you and your colleagues who help to keep our feet on practical ground. ""Ladies and Gentlemen: We are ambitious for Britain. ""We should be proud of the enormous wealth of talent that exists in this country. ""Our young people have so much to offer and education is the key. ""Sadly these talents are being squandered by a Labour Government that believes the bureaucrat knows best, that thinks inspiration lies on page 34 of a 100 page government circular, that aspires only to political correctness and that is ashamed of Britain our history and our culture. ""What a wasted opportunity. The reality of education under Labour is that class sizes are rising, disruptive children are kept in class, teachers are leaving in droves, too much money is spent on red tape, and standards are stagnating, ""Government policy has completely lost touch with the real world. One minister even wants to stop young children playing musical chairs! ""Earlier this year the Government paid £4million to consultants to produce a 234 page report which reveals that to be effective a teacher must - wait for it - plan lessons well. ""Over the past year the Department for Education and Employment has sent out one publication every hour a teacher is at work. ""It`s not surprising that since Labour came to power nearly 100,000 teachers have left the profession. Earlier this year a head teacher in the North East was so disillusioned that he left to become a lorry driver. A primary teacher leaving her job to become a chauffeur saying ""I was faced with masses of paperwork every day which was very time consuming and not what I became a teacher to do"". ""And what of Labour`s broken promises? ""David Blunkett promised that grammar schools were safe in Labour`s hands. Tell that to the parents and teachers of Ripon Grammar School and Ripon College who had to spend months working to save their schools in the face of Labour`s rigged grammar school ballots. ""David Blunkett once told a Labour Party Conference ""Watch my lips no selection by examination or interview"". Now he says that was a joke. Children`s education is no joke Mr Blunkett. Ladies and Gentlemen watch my lips - the next Conservative Government will abolish the grammar school ballots. ""David Blunkett promised grant maintained schools they had nothing to fear from Labour. Tell that to the headteachers worrying about yet more budget cuts- cuts that have averaged £150,000 per school. ""David Blunkett promised head teachers they would get their budget direct. Two weeks ago he turned his back on them. Nothing will change and Labour town hall bosses will still be able to hold money back from our schools and children. ""Why? - Because this Labour government is arrogant - they think they know what`s best ""They`re out of touch - they just don`t know what is happening in the classrooms ""And they don`t trust parents and teachers. ""We do trust parents. That`s why we will increase parental choice and give parents the power to change schools where standards are failing. And we will give parents better information about the standards in their local schools by bringing in value-added tables, which better measure the quality of education at the school. ""And we trust teachers. That`s why we will give them the freedom to get on with the job our dedicated teachers want to do - teaching children and raising standards - without constant form-filling and interfering red tape. ""We have a new approach to raising standards in our schools. By making every school a Free School we will improve the quality of education and ensure that every child is receiving the education that is right for them. ""Free Schools will enable Heads, teachers and governors to decide what is best for the children in each school. The bureaucrats in Whitehall don`t know what`s best; and in today`s fast-changing world the traditional model of local authority control of schools does not allow each school enough freedom to be creative to maximise children`s potential. ""Free Schools will get their budget direct. It will be based on a national funding formula, which will take account of certain differing needs, but will start to reduce the current disparities in funding across council boundaries. ""Too much money is held back from schools. Too much is wasted on bureaucracy. On this year`s figures our Free Schools policy would have meant on average an extra £540 for every child. ""Free Schools will be able to keep their sixth forms - free from Labour`s threat of lower funding or closure. ""Free Schools will be free to set admissions policy - and I`m confident that yes, there will be more grammar schools in future. ""Free Schools mean a different role for central government. No more bureaucrats in Whitehall dedicated to drafting yet more circulars with which to bombard teachers and governors. ""Free Schools also mean a different role for local councils - not running schools, but providing certain children`s services such as education welfare and statementing for special educational needs. Our thanks are due to all those who given so much over the years as councillors on LEAs. The future will be different. Our goal is to give children the best education possible and we must not be afraid to do what is necessary to achieve it. ""Free Schools means a new role for governors who will be freed from much of today`s bureaucratic burdens, and who will have clearer responsibilities and powers. ""Ofsted will be given the power to conduct spot inspections - seeing a school as it really is not after weeks of preparation. ""One of Labour`s first acts was to abolish the Assisted Places Scheme depriving children from less well-off families of educational opportunities. Ladies and Gentlemen I can tell you today - the next Conservative Government will introduce a new Assisted Places Scheme. ""The quality of education a child receives depends on the quality of their teachers. Our many hard working and committed teachers are fed up with a government that doesn`t trust them. ""We want to set teachers free to get on with the job of teaching. ""Teachers and parents also worry about discipline in the classroom. The disruptive few must not be allowed to damage the education of the many. The next Conservative Government will give Head teachers the power to expel disruptive pupils putting parents minds at rest that their child`s education will not be damaged by the disruptive few. ""And there will be no appeal to the local authority - so the school can`t be forced to keep disruptive pupils in class by some politically correct Labour council. ""The expelled pupils will not be forgotten as too many have been in the past. They will be given a full time education in Progress Centres away from the school site, but they will no longer be denying education to others. ""But we need to do more to support teachers. Teachers are more vulnerable than any other group of professionals to false allegations of abuse from children. An NASUWT survey last year showed that over 80% of allegations made against teachers were false. Yet, the system seems to believe that an allegation is in itself proof of guilt. And teachers can find their names blazoned across the newspapers, their careers shattered - and all on the basis of a false accusation. ""I heard last night of a teacher of 27 years who was falsely accused of abuse by a pupil. He lost his job, his role as a foster parent, and his role in the local scouts. His life ruined by a malicious accusation. ""The next Conservative Government will give teachers anonymity in the media until the point where the police decide to press charges. The press will not be allowed to print their names or photos while the accusation is being investigated. Teachers lives should not be ruined by mischievous or malicious accusations. ""We will do more to support those entering the profession. I have heard too many stories of teachers not being trained to teach children to read. Teacher training is too theoretical. Why on earth should someone training to be a teacher have to study ""the politics of difference""? ""The next Conservative Government will reform teacher training. Under the Conservatives trainee teachers will spend 80% of their time in schools and only 20% in college. More than three-quarters of a teacher`s training will be spent learning the skills and craft of teaching. Schools which are centres of excellence will be able to become training schools with funding and support to back that up. In future trainee teachers will learn how to teach in practice not just in theory. ""Free Schools will raise standards in our schools. They will be free to be the good schools parents want with an enthusiasm for learning, a strong ethos and values. ""But we need to support our FE Colleges and universities too. They need their freedom. FE Colleges will be given back freedoms Labour have taken away by changing their governing bodies and threatening them with Whitehall diktats on what courses they can offer. ""And our universities need to be set free from government controls that mean they find it ever more difficult to compete on the world stage. Our young people deserve the best. With funding per student falling, Labour certain to introduce top-up fees, and universities finding it increasingly difficult to recruit and retain staff, standards in our universities are under threat as never before. ""We owe it to our young people to stem the tide. That is why we will progressively endow universities. We will invest the proceeds from the sale of government assets like the radio spectrum in our universities setting them free of excessive bureaucratic control and interference and ensuring their academic freedom. Endowed universities would be free to recover their global pre-eminence and build a world role. ""And they need to retain freedom over admissions. How arrogant of Gordon Brown to think he knows better than Oxford University who should be admitted to read medicine. And how irresponsible. In one speech he has done more to discourage state school pupils from aspiring to go to our leading universities than anyone else. The real problem is low expectations in state schools held back over years by Labour`s dogmatic insistence on levelling down standards. ""We also want to help people into jobs. The Government`s New Deal is no deal for the 40,000 who`ve gone back onto benefit, the 60,000 who have failed to get a sustained unsubsidised job, or the 92,000 who left for an unknown destination. In fact far from finding jobs for 250,000 young people as Labour promised, the New Deal has only found jobs for 13,000. ""We know that the best thing for someone who wants a job is to get into a job. That`s why we will replace the costly and ineffective New Deal with 'Britain Works'. 'Britain Works' will give people the practical every day skills to get them into a job and help to keep them there. ""Ladies and Gentlemen, for too long education in this country has been bedevilled by interference from the educational establishment. If we do nothing to stop this, our education system will grind to a standstill with falling standards betraying our children and damaging our county`s future. ""Free Schools and Universities will enable us to develop the wealth of talents in this country to aspire to be the best. ""There are those who say it won`t work, there are some who say it shouldn`t be done and there are those who say it can`t be done. ""We know from Grant maintained schools that it will work. ""For the sake of our young people to enable them to develop their talents to the full, it must be done. ""With the will and determination and fired by an ambition for this country of quality education for all it can be done. ""And Ladies and Gentlemen it will be done by the next Conservative Government."
"7","Liam Fox"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-03,"At our conference this week voters don't need us to remind them that health has actually got worse under Labour. They don't need us to remind them that their tax has gone up with nothing to show for it. They don't need me to remind them about the increased number of people waiting to get treated, the jobs for Labour cronies, the repeated announcements, the PR stunts, sound-bites, photo opportunities, re-launches, postcode rationing, trolley waits, cancelled operations and the elderly 'not for resuscitation'. And all at the hands of a Prime Minister and Secretary of State who represent the most smug, arrogant, complacent, out of touch, 'blame someone else' and downright incompetent administration the NHS has ever known. No, they don't need to be reminded - so I won't. But disillusionment with Labour is not enough. What people rightly want to know is what we would do differently. We are the Government in waiting. It is our duty to outline our approach. Let's begin by dispensing with Labour's great lies in leaflets like these. We will match Labour's spending plans for health pound for pound. We believe in a comprehensive National Health Service funded from taxation free at the point of use. When Alan Milburn was still peddling CND propaganda in his socialist bookshop, I was one of those overworked junior doctors in the NHS. I spent all my working life before politics as a doctor in the NHS so when Tony Blair says that we intend to cut doctors and nurses, he is not only lying but he knows he is lying. Unlike Labour's NHS, ours will be one with proper priorities, where the sickest patients are treated first. Where the value of our care is measured by more than just the numbers treated. Where doctors decide which patients are treated, and not bureaucrats and where politicians stop interfering. Where new partnerships are formed inside the NHS and between the public and private sectors. It doesn't matter to us where a patient is treated but when a patient is treated and the quality of that treatment. Patients have a right to expect us to arrange the best treatment we can . If we can use the private sector to speed up the treatment of NHS patients then we should do so. We should not be treated by the State like some Dickensian paupers having our gruel dispensed and expected to say thank you because it's all there is. We are citizens and taxpayers in the world's fourth biggest economy at the beginning of the 21st century. We have a right to expect something better. But rights also imply responsibilities. Patients who make emergency night calls for trivial complaints, who use ambulances as a taxi service, or who fail to turn up for their hospital appointments are denying others potentially life saving services. And it can not continue. REMOVING POLITICAL INTERFERENCE Sometimes when I look at the NHS, I think that only a fool would believe that you can run a service that employs almost a million people from behind a Minister's desk in London. It is crazy to believe that one person can tackle the different and detailed health needs of Penzance, Preston and Peckham with a single 'one size fits all' solution dreamed up in Whitehall. And it is unacceptable that a party political Secretary of State can decide who sits on every health authority and pack it with his own supporters. We will bring this disreputable and shameful practice to an end. Actually, by letting the experts run the NHS I intend to be the least over worked Health Secretary in history. SETTING THE RIGHT PRIORITIES Next, we must change the targets we use. For too long, under Conservative as well as Labour Governments, we have been obsessed with targets based on input or throughput. In other words, you are doing a better job if you spend more money irrespective of how you spend it or if you treat more patients, irrespective of whether or not they are the right patients. That is not a sensible approach. We need to have targets which are based on the outcomes for patients. That means we need to raise our cure rates and survival rates to match those in neighbouring countries. It is not acceptable that if we develop lung cancer or breast cancer or colonic cancer or heart disease that our chances of survival are sometimes only half of the Dutch or Germans or Americans. But meaningful targets need investment and not just slogans. That is why, although we will match Labour's spending plans for health we will spend that money very differently. Our plans mean that investment will be directed towards priority areas beginning with cardiac and cancer services as a first step in delivering our Patients Guarantee. And we will abolish Labour's iniquitous waiting list initiative which so distorts clinical priorities. Am I the only one who believes it is unethical and immoral to deny lifesaving treatments in order to speed up more minor ones? Am I the only one who finds it repulsive that patients have their cancer or cardiac surgery cancelled while surgeons are forced to carry out more hernia surgery so that ministers can claim better figures? Am I the only one who believes that the sickest patients should be treated first? It is time we had a system based on sound values, not sound bites. Yet there are those who urge us to reject this approach. They say ""Don't do it. You may speed up cancer care and improve cardiac care but there are more people with ingrowing toenails, varicose veins and sebaceous cysts and they all have votes."" Has our society really become that shallow? Do we really believe that people really think of no one but themselves ? I don't believe so. Too many of us here today will have had family, friends or neighbours who have died prematurely as a result of the failure to prioritise our health care. I believe that in the British people there is a sense of fairness and decency which is offended by this Government's approach. We Conservatives must be their voice. Politics is not about following focus groups but informing and leading public opinion. It is time we got back to doing what is right not just what is popular in the short term. THE BEST USE OF OUR STAFF AND RESOURCES Of course, the NHS cannot only be about life threatening conditions and, in time, we want to see all waiting times reduced. That is why, as a first step, we support the idea of ""stand alone"" surgical units for procedures such as cataract surgery or hip replacements. These units, dedicated to a single type of treatment, could work more efficiently (perhaps even round the clock) enabling us to end the scandal of operations being cancelled at the last minute. Under Labour the NHS is increasingly being run British Leyland in the 1970s where you don't want to be sick after five o'clock or at weekends and heaven help you if it is a public holiday. Indeed there is a general need to use our staff more efficiently. As a GP, I spent a lot of time doing things for which I was over-trained. We don't need someone with nine years training to take blood pressures or blood samples. Doctors and nurses need to be used at the ceiling of their abilities. For example in my own area of general practice I want to see GPs develop specialist skills to complement their generalist role. When a parent takes their child to the doctor with a problem it would be nice to see someone who had experience in paediatrics or if a woman goes with post menopausal bleeding she should be able to see someone who has trained in gynaecology. Many of our GPs already work as clinical assistants in hospital out- patients clinics. It makes sense to develop a new level of care in general practice, with semi specialist GPs so that patients can be seen more quickly and locally and hospital outpatient clinics are used for those who genuinely require a Consultant level service. In the same way, I believe nursing has come of age. In breaking down the territorial barriers we will offer nurses a real opportunity to make full use of their skills. These developments will have impacts on training. We need to recruit nurses from a wide spectrum and training must be flexible enough to accommodate a whole range of skills from simple patient care to further academic development. We must never forget that holding the hand of someone who is afraid can be just as important as operating complex equipment. And it is time that we all got back to recognising something we seem to have forgotten - that nursing and medicine are not just jobs but a vocation, and should be valued as such. EXPANDING THE PRIVATE SECTOR Despite the lies being perpetrated by the Labour leadership, we have repeatedly made it clear that we will match Labour's planned health spending. It will be welcome and it will allow a vital expansion of our health care. But it will not be enough in itself. If we want to see total spending on health care brought up to European levels we will need to see the private sector increased as well as the NHS. That means making private health care more attractive. To be blunt, the private sector also needs a shake-up. Too many products for individual private health care are too expensive, inflexible, with too many exemptions and covering you for everything except anything you have ever had. This is especially difficult for the elderly made worse by the Government's removal of their tax relief on private health. This is a government that seems to have entirely abandoned the elderly. Labour have also hit company schemes too adding yet another burden to the NHS. We must not back away from the challenge to make private health care more attractive in addition to the extra NHS spending. A bigger cake benefits everyone if a real partnership is introduced. In order to encourage company schemes we will abolish disincentives in the taxation system where and when we can afford to do so. This will ensure that additional provision is available to as wide a range of our fellow citizens as possible. Choice in healthcare should not just be for the well-off. By improving choice within the NHS and making access to the private sector cheaper and easier we can bring our spending on health up to the levels of other western countries and close the real health gap. Labour will oppose us, just as they opposed Conservative trade union reforms which gave individuals more power and just as they opposed Margaret Thatcher's council house sales which gave so many a share in prosperity. Our instincts were right then and they are right now. Labour support the state. We support people. A better NHS and an expanded private sector working in a real partnership can benefit all our people. MATRON'S VALUES But health is not just about structures and money. It is also about values. I want to see a return to what I would call 'Matron's Values'. It seems ludicrous to me that ward sisters are not in control of cleaning wards and feeding patients. When the ward sister says jump the response should be ""How high?"", and not ""I need to call my supervisor."" We need to give those who have the responsibility for patient care the authority as well. One of my elderly neighbours has just come out of hospital. She was very unwell and unable to eat as well as being extremely deaf. For dinner she was given some rock-hard battered fish. There was a time when someone would have said make this lady some scrambled eggs which she can eat. But no, half an hour later the offending fish was simply whisked away untouched. I'm sure you all know similar examples. It is not about major policy initiatives. It is about seeing patients as people not illnesses with a nametag. Sometimes in health it's the little things that matter most. And another thing. I cannot bear this habit of calling people, especially elderly people by their first name when they don't want it. My grandmother was never called Sarah in her life, not even by my grandfather. (I won't say what he called her). She was always known as Mrs. Young. When she became confused she didn't know who this Sarah was. And it's not good enough. We must understand that we are dealing with individuals who have their own identities, sensitivities and pride which should be respected. The Cabinet may call one another Tony and Jack and Mo. Our patients have earned greater respect. Dignity is their irreducible core. TELLING THE TRUTH We have a great challenge ahead in the debate on health - to tell the truth. There is no endless flow of money. We cannot do everything we would like as quickly as we would like. Medical science is expanding faster than our ability to fund it. In the real world choices must be made, priorities must be set. There has always been rationing and there always will be. We must have the courage to say what we know to be true. And yes that means if doctors from overseas are not properly qualified and do not have adequate communication skills, then we will say so, irrespective of the knee jerk reaction of the PC brigade and their media allies. You know promising things you cannot deliver in politics is cynical and creates resentment. But promising things you know you cannot deliver to the sick and vulnerable is wicked and cruel. That is the charge at Labour's door. We must show that we are not just a party of pounds, shillings and pence. We must show what sort of Britain we want to live in and how we will achieve it. Our way will be different. Where health care is run for the patients not the politicians. Where decisions are made by doctors and nurses not bureaucrats. Where heart bypasses are not given the same priority as in-growing toenails. Where vocation is once again valued. Where we treat patients with dignity as individuals, where we tell the truth and do what we believe is right in tune with our beliefs, our experience and our values. It is time to restore faith in health. Let Labour play follow the focus group. Let us say what must be said and do what must be done. Let our party prepare again to lead our Nation."
"8","Bernard Jenkin"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-03,"The demonstrations last month proved that Labour is out of touch. The frustration has been building up for years. You think that your car is to get you to work, or to visit the family, or to do the shopping. But it's not. Under Labour, the most important job your car does is to siphon money out of your bank account and over to the Chancellor. Labour's taxes are such an injustice. Petrol tax is a regressive tax. It hits the poor the hardest. For example, a disabled pensioner in my constituency needs her car to get to the shops and to see her friends. She used to spend £10 per week on petrol. Now it costs £20. This is just one rural pensioner who is worse off under Labour - one of millions. And as the pressure has mounted, Labour has simply become more devious. In the last Budget, Gordon Brown said he was putting petrol tax and pensions up by the rate of inflation. What he didn't tell you was that he was using two different rates of inflation. So he put pensions up by just 1.1% - but hiked fuel tax by three times that. He said, he could only give pensioners an extra 75p a week, but he took away all of that and more with his fuel taxes. Labour gives with one hand and takes away with another. And another, and another. People have been driven to distraction by this stealth taxing government. Driven to do things they never imagined they would do. The government calls the protests 'blockades'. But there were no blockades. The people who protested against the government last month were not the trotskyites, communists, militants and anarchists that Jack Straw marched with in his youth. They were decent, hardworking people. People with responsibilities, businesses, customers, overdrafts, employees and families to support. They were supported by a spontaneous groundswell of public feeling. What an indictment of British democracy under Labour! Three years of Labour has pushed the British people to breaking point. Labour had no right to raise taxes. They have no mandate. Mr Blair promised no new taxes. Democracy should be about government by consent. But Labour is about taxation without representation. That's why the protests were so popular. These protests rumbled Labour's tax scam. These protests showed that the British people will not stand for it. These protests exposed Mr Blair, in the face of a real crisis, as weak and vacillating. Labour cannot face the truth. Oh, he could apologise for the Dome. He could apologise for the Ecclestone affair. But he can't apologise for this. Because his stealth tax deceit goes to the heart of his whole political strategy. And I say now to everyone who is angry about fuel tax. William Hague and the Conservative Party are the champions of your cause. We will cut fuel tax. So, put your faith in the ballot box and not the barricades! Don't get angry. Get even! Labour failures: the missed opportunity So what has John Prescott actually done in the last three years? He put a bus lane on the M4 so that the New Labour elite could whizz past the queues. He took an environmentally friendly car for a spin, and then crashed it. At last year's Labour conference here in Bournemouth, he was driven 200 yards from the Highcliff to here, so that he could tell us to use our cars less. And so it goes on. But while Prescott gaffes, everyone else must suffer. As rural post offices and banks close, more and more people who cannot afford cars are being left stranded. Everyday misery. That's Labour's record. Last month in London, 2000 Central Line passengers were stuck, stifling in dark tunnels for more than two hours. Everyday misery. That's Labour's record. Pity the millions stuck in traffic jams every day! Pity the towns and villages, choked with traffic, still waiting for a bypass. Pity the haulage firms going bust. Everyday misery. That's Labour's record. The 10 year plan And after three years of misery, John Prescott now has the nerve to stand up and say 'I've got a ten year transport plan'. Suddenly he is promising billions but do you believe him? And hardly anything would happen until after the next TWO general elections. Talk about post-dated cheques! What does he take us for? The words, 'ten year transport plan' should enter the same lexicon as 'the dog ate my homework', and 'the Dome will be a great success'. This is a ten year plan from a one term government that can't see further than tomorrow's headlines. A broken policy that follows broken promises proposed by a broken-backed Secretary of State. Last year he was asked whether the job might be a bit too big for one person. Plucky John replied: 'No, because I'm Superman'. Superman! Superman didn't need two Jags and a helicopter to get from A to B. Mind you, he's the only comic strip minister who breaks his promises, faster than a speeding bullet. In 1997, he promised there would be far fewer journeys by car. Well, John, if you don't know already, short of a fuel crisis, you've failed. Socialists always think they can change human nature. Well there's only one way they have succeeded. Today, every nine seconds, the average healthy man now thinks about petrol tax. How much it costs. Where will it end? Under Labour, we'll soon all have to take our driving tests on foot. The sad reality is that by the end of this Parliament, John Prescott will have precisely nothing to show for his four years in office. And over the next ten years, Labour plans to raise at least £423 billion in taxes from the motorist. That's over £18,000 per household. You could buy one of John Prescott's Jags for that, but you couldn't afford to run it! The Conservatives made the car a privilege for the many and not just the few. The car and public transport are not enemies or opposites. We need them both. We need more of them both. There's no point in investing billions more in the railways if you miss your train because you're stuck in a traffic jam. Few of us have train stations or bus stops outside our front door. So let's get rid of Labour's anti-car ideology. Conservative Transport Policy The next Conservative government will dump all the dogma. We will ditch the jargon. We believe in Britain. So, we will simply get on with the job. On day one of the next Conservative government, we will abolish Labour's Integrated Transport Commission. That will save millions by reducing bureaucracy and waste. We believe in a prosperous Britain. So we want Britain's lifeblood arteries - our roads - to flow. We will immediately bring forward the vital road improvements to get unsuitable traffic off unsuitable roads. We believe in a cleaner and greener Britain. So we want to remove through traffic from towns and villages. You use less fuel if you don't have to sit in traffic jams. We will also reduce congestion by charging companies who dig up the road. We believe road users deserve better. So over all of this we shall set up a new Roads Inspectorate. This will set standards for local councils and the Highways Agency to meet. It will demand action on poor roads, dangerous roads or where roads cause environmental problems. Conservatives also believe in Britain's railways. Labour inherited the start of our railway renaissance - liberated from state control. But we are still waiting for stage two. We propose measures to cut standing on cramped trains; And to cut queuing for your ticket. And to increase trains on Sundays. And we believe in freight on rail. The rail freight renaissance was started by privatisation. Believing in Britain means putting the passenger and the freight customer first. Not just on rail, but across all our transport networks. And, of course, our commitment to cut 14 pence off a gallon of petrol is just a first step. Because we are ambitious for Britain we will not treat motorists as some sort of revenue tap. We believe in honesty in taxation. So we want petrol stations to display just how much of what you are paying is tax. We also believe in British business, and we need the haulage industry. So we will introduce the BRIT disc. So that foreign trucks will have to pay for using Britain's roads. We will use that money to cut the punitive tax on British trucks so they can compete with Europe. But I give you one supreme pledge. Our first day in government - and every day - will be about safety. This week is the anniversary of the terrible Paddington rail crash. The shock of that tragedy hangs heavy in the memory. I pledge eternal vigilance on safety. We have proposed to the Paddington Inquiry a new rail safety regime. For the first time, there should be specific rail safety legislation - like there is in aviation. There should be a new National Rail Regulator, with responsibility for performance AND safety; And a new independent rail accident investigation branch of the DETR. There is no reason why privatised railways should not be every bit as safe as our privatised airlines and airports. And would that our roads were as safe as the railways. We will establish a Road Casualty Investigation body, to look into the causes of road accidents. If you lose someone you love in a road accident, you want to know why it happened and what will be done to stop it happening again. More than 3,000 people die each year on our roads. That must change. There is far more to road safety than just speed humps and cameras. The government needs a proper, factual and statistical basis for road safety policy. That will enable us to set the right road safety priorities, to reduce death and injury as effectively as possible. It can be done without demonising the car, because we believe in the good sense and humanity of the vast majority of the British people. That's believing in Britain. Peroration Mr Chairman, conference. Millions of people every day make millions of transport choices. People want choice. Conservative governments increase choice. That's why people are beginning to feel they want a new Conservative government. That's why a new Conservative government, under William Hague, will get the best for Britain, because we believe in the full potential of what British people can achieve. Last, week we saw the Labour party on the run. Mr Blair was blustering like a magician whose tricks have failed to deceive. WE are making Labour sweat! And look at Mr Prescott's contorted face! Conservatives believe in Britain, because we are ambitious for our country. We believe in a Britain, whose transport networks should be the envy of the world. A Britain where the opportunity to travel is for the many and not the few. A Britain where the passenger and the road user come first. A Britain where everyone shares in the benefits of prosperity. A Britain strong, independent and free. A Britain, whose government believes in Britain. And the Conservatives, under William Hague, are ready to be that government."
"9","David Willetts"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-04,"Good morning! May I begin by thanking the many people who have contributed to our debate this morning and particularly Robert Halfon and Karen Lumley. You have already heard this morning from Eric Pickles, described by one sketch-writer as ""that splendid sausage roll of a Parliamentarian"". And you have heard as well from Jacqui Lait. She is going to tear up those rigid rules on annuities which hit so many people when they retire. Thanks too to our Whip, John Randall. And in the Lords there are Terence Higgins, Peta Buscombe, and Johnny Astor. They do something we commoners find rather more difficult - they actually defeat the Government. It is thanks to them, for example, that war widows will now be able to keep their service pensions when they re-marry - so even in Opposition we Conservatives are tackling injustice. We literally cannot afford to go on as we are under this hopeless Government. They promised so much and have delivered so little. They promised bold reforms of the welfare state. But what happens? Whenever the Social Security Secretary takes a proposal to Number 10 he is told ""Not now Darling"". Once more it will be left to a Conservative Government to reform social security. That means getting a grip on spending and we have already identified £3 billion of savings. It means getting unemployed people back to work - that is what our Can Work, Must Work Guarantee is all about. And above all it means giving more help to those people who really need it - families, disabled people, pensioners. Many people this morning have raised pensions - unlike the Government. Every pensioner and millions more besides have been outraged by the measly 75 pence increase on the pension. We Conservatives share that outrage. I'll give you one simple reason why people have lost confidence in this government. When it came to putting up fuel duty in his Budget, Gordon Brown said the inflation rate was 3.4 per cent. But when it came to the pension the inflation rate had miraculously fallen to only 1.1 per cent. So it is one figure for the motorist and another figure for the pensioner. But there is one thing they have in common. They have both rumbled this wretched Labour Government. What a way to treat the generation that fought in the War. But Tony Blair does not value our history. He does not value our traditions. And that is why he does not value our pensioners. He did not even bother to turn up to the 60th anniversary of the Battle of Britain. Now Tony Blair tells us he has got an irreducible core. That is presumably somewhere above his bottom line and below his bleeding heart. A recent Labour briefing revealed what Labour thinks about pensioners. Peter Mandelson said there was ""no mileage"" to be had from them. The Chairman of the Labour Party said they were ""racist"". And then, the final insult, he said they were ""predominantly Conservative"". Well, at least we are going to prove him right on that. Labour claim that instead of putting money into the basic state pension they have put more into means-tested benefits. I cannot imagine why they should want to boast that more pensioners will have to wrestle with the complicated 40-page form for their so-called Minimum Income Guarantee. It requires 323 separate items of information, including such gems as, 'Are you or your partner pregnant?'. It is not even true that they have directed lots of extra money to the poorest pensioners. Five times as much is going into complicated ill-targeted schemes such as winter fuel payments. And last week they compounded the confusion by announcing even more special schemes. But pensioners do not want patronising gimmicks. What they want is the respect and dignity that comes from the basic contributory pension. That is why we have pledged that a Conservative Government would put every pound that goes into Gordon's gimmicks into the basic pension instead. But we are not stopping there. We are doing more than that. We are putting in an extra £320 million saved from elsewhere in the social security budget. That means we can promise pensioners that a Conservative uprating in 2001 would range from £5.50 for a single pensioner under 75 to £10 for a married couple over 75. No ifs, no buts, no special application forms, no loss of means-tested benefits, no extra tax. Even Barbara Castle of all people said our policy was ""an absolute vote-winner"". If Gordon Brown uprates the pension by more than inflation - we will accept that and still add our reform package on top. So we can look every pensioner in the eye and say ""You will be better off under the Conservatives"". Our proposal guarantees more money to pensioners. But more than that it offers dignity, respect and trust. A pensioner in Suffolk wrote to me and put it like this: 'I wonder how long it will be for them to get it into their thick heads that pensioners do not want crumbs thrown to them from Lord and Lady Bountiful Blair's table …….. We wish to pay our way like everybody else and object strongly when we are made to become forelock-touching, cap-in-hand, second-class citizens.' We understand that anger. Labour do not. Let me quote from a newspaper article entitled 'Ministers want trendy name for pensioners'. It states: 'Ministers want to re-brand pensioners with a trendy name that will appeal to younger people. Ministers believe that words like pensions or elderly carry a grey image which deters younger people from thinking ahead.' There is more: Some of Whitehall's finest minds are working on the problem, whilst the Government is also seeking outside help to try to come up with a new title'. Doesn't that say it all? They are thinking of new names while we are coming up with new policies. But we mustn't just discharge our obligations to today's pensioners. We have also got to plan for tomorrow's pensioners. We want the next generation to have bigger, better, funded pensions. We can only achieve that if we encourage saving now. Labour are presiding over a catastrophic fall in the amount that we as a nation are saving. Do you know what is the worst single statistic about this Government's economic record? When we left office the average household was saving over £10 for every £100 of income. And do you know what that is now? It is down to £3 for every £100 of household income. That is a direct consequence of hitting pension funds with the worst stealth tax of the lot. Five billion pounds wiped off the pensions of the people of this country. Let me make one thing absolutely clear about our proposal for future pensioners. The basic pension stays for anyone who wants to stick with it. We are offering younger workers the option of building up a real fund instead of having to depend on the basic state pension. If someone under 30 were allocated £500 a year to put into a fund and it performed as well as the market has done since the War, it would build up to a pension for a single person not of £67 but £130. It is another step towards our great Conservative vision of a property-owning democracy. We don't just believe in saving because it makes financial sense - though it does. It is also part of our belief in strong families. It is tough bringing up children nowadays. Families often feel that they are struggling to bring up their children decently in a hostile environment. Our responsibility as politicians is to ease those pressures. That is why William Hague has rightly pledged us to recognise marriage in the tax system once more. But isn't it a pity that the media only show dysfunctional families in their soap operas. We've all seen those gritty domestic dramas. Let me just pick some of the characters at random. There's Tony who doesn't get on with his neighbour Gordon. Mo storms out, fed-up with the backbiting. They all hate Peter who is not invited to Gordon's wedding. And as for John, he thinks Tony's a bit stuck up and doesn't get on with his wife! In one script John says to Tony, ""It's all right for you, you've got a wife who earns £250,000 a year. I've got a wife who spends £250,000 a year"". That's fine as soap opera but we shouldn't let them anywhere near government. Let's keep it in Coronation Street, not Downing Street. Gordon Brown is trapping families in the most complicated benefit system they have ever faced. There is the working families tax credit. The child care credit. The children`s tax credit. Soon we will have the integrated child credit. And don't forget the employment tax credit. Gordon Brown should be simplifying the tax and benefit system. Instead he is constructing a passable imitation of Spaghetti Junction on a Bank Holiday! And millions of decent British families are trapped in it. Labour won't tackle it. We will. And it's not just families that suffer. Gordon Brown wants these credits to be administered by hard-pressed employers. Small businesses are already fed up with being unpaid tax collectors for the Government. But now they are unpaid benefit offices as well. Gordon Brown proudly announced the working families tax credit assisted by, and I quote from the normally sober pages of the Financial Times, 'Dennis the Menace, Postman Pat and a Womble'. The trouble is that he then invited them back to the Treasury to devise the details of the policy. But don't worry. The Inland Revenue are going to make it as easy as possible for employers to administer the new credits. Just look at what they have come up with. [display chart] And this is the special, simplified version. All you need is a forfeit card and a pair of dice. That is why we are committed to reforming the working families tax credit and once more paying it as a benefit to the caring parent. The more complicated Labour make benefits the greater the risk of error and the easier it is to perpetrate fraud. The level of fraud in our social security system is nothing short of a national scandal. Labour claim to be tough on fraud but all they ever do is issue press notices about it. They are not after results. They are after headlines. We all know Labour's approach: · more summits than the Himalayas · more crusades than Richard the Lion Heart · more Tsars than the Russians But all the sound and spin and hype signifies nothing, absolutely nothing. Do you know how many suspected cases there were of fraud in Housing and Council Tax Benefit alone last year? 160,000. And do you know how many successful prosecutions there were? 800. That is one prosecution every 200 cases. It is a national scandal. I can tell Conference today that we will establish a single National Benefit Fraud Squad. It has already been recommended in an official report, but that's gathering dust in the DSS. A Conservative Government will tackle fraud more vigorously and more effectively than ever before. We Conservatives want a social security system that doesn't make fools of decent people. We want a social security system that is part of making a better society. We want a social security system that respects and values pensioners. That is why instead of gimmicks we offer security. Instead of complication we offer simplicity. Instead of spin we offer substance. Instead of Tony Blair we offer William Hague."
"10","Ann Widdecombe"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-04,"My birthday only comes once a year. And what a great Party! But Jack Straw gives the criminals a party every day while victims wait outside in the cold. His greetings telegram to the criminal is: 'don't worry, there are nearly 3,000 fewer police to catch you, and even if you are unlucky enough to be caught, I'll let you out of jail in record time.' In The Wizard of Oz, the Man of Straw had no brain. I can show you one with no heart and no courage as well. He and his friend Tony promised to be 'tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime'. All they've been tough on is the dwindling number of people trying to fight crime. Last year, I warned that the thin blue line was getting thinner. Now it's becoming a row of dots, which nobody wants to join. High on promises, low on action. Long on spin, short on truth. Drunk on power, incapable of delivery. It's not that they're short on rhetoric when it comes to victims. Remember what Tony Blair said in his speech last week? Tony Blair said that one of the big projects for the second term of a Labour government - and I quote - would be 'standing up for victims'. Why is he waiting for a second term? It's not as if he's going to get one. What a sense of priorities. They've spent the first term getting prisoners out of jail early, cutting the police force, multiplying red tape, and dreaming of drunks at cashpoints. The victim has to wait for the second term. By contrast, my first pledge as Shadow Home Secretary, the very first policy I announced, was new rights for victims enshrined in law. That shows where this Party's priorities lie. What about the rest of Jack Straw's record at the Home Office? Police numbers down, crime up, violent crime soaring, the asylum system in chaos, spies laughing at the country they betrayed… When we were debating rising crime under this Government, I asked Jack Straw whether crime would fall again. He said: 'That depends on the criminals.' I thought it was traditional for the British people to rely on their Government to cut crime, not on the criminals. It cannot be common sense to fight crime with fewer crimefighters. It cannot be common sense, when the police have spent time and effort arresting people, to see the criminal back on the street before the police officer. It cannot be common sense to let prisoners sit around in idleness. It cannot be common sense to allow persistent young menaces to grow up with the belief that they are untouchable at law. It cannot be common sense to arrest the householder instead of the burglar. We need common sense. This country needs a well-motivated, strong police force that can protect everyone, regardless of race, colour or creed. But when the police have done their job, the public must be protected by proper, effective sentencing. When those sentences include custody, protecting the public doesn't end at the prison gate. It means work and education inside prisons to give inmates the skills to lead a law-abiding life outside. You are already aware that we have promised to restore police numbers. But numbers alone are not the only answer. We must make sure that every single policeman makes the most effective use of every minute of his time. Yet officers regularly tell me that they can spend an entire shift processing a single criminal through custody, and that they have to fill in the same information on form after form. Indeed, from what they tell me I can only conclude that the police have got more form than the criminals they arrest. For too long, politicians have observed this and done nothing. It is time to relieve the police of this crippling burden. It is plain common sense that a policeman should come into the station, deliver his prisoner with a short statement and go straight back onto the beat to arrest more criminals. And that's what's going to happen on my watch. And if that means taking a large part of the custody function away from the police, that's what I'll do. So we're going to restore the numbers. And we're going to make sure they spend their time more effectively. And we're going to make sure that they spend their time in the rural areas as well as the urban. Many rural people feel isolated from the forces of law and order. They rarely see their local bobby. Where there is an emergency, they wait far too long for a response. For those who live in sparsely populated areas, this is a real, live problem. So I've been looking for real, live solutions. I believe that there are lots of ways that we can get visible policing in our countryside. Through retained police officers, part-time police officers, specials, greater use of retired officers, and through 'cops in shops'. Cops in shops is a very simple initiative, which I saw in Washington. The officer doesn't go back to the station to write up his reports, he writes them up in shops and other public places. This has a threefold advantage. First of all, he's visible. Secondly, he can interact with the community. And thirdly, he is a deterrent. One of the reasons why we have such problems in recruiting is that very often, young people lose interest between the time they leave school and the time they are old enough to join the police. So I want to re-introduce a police cadet force which will not only provide a recruiting and training ground for both the regular police and the specials, but will fundamentally change young people's attitude towards the police at a time in their lives when it is most important. Instead of being tough on criminals, Tony Blair and Jack Straw operate a revolving door prisons policy. On Jack Straw's own tagging scheme, criminals sentenced to six months get out of jail in six weeks - even John Prescott gets through more of his sentences. And so 23,000 convicts have been let out early. Including 200 convicted killers Thousands of other violent criminals. Nearly 150 convicted of assaulting police. More than 900 robbers Over 2,100 burglars 3,000 drug dealers And when, but for Jack Straw's measure, they should have been in jail, these criminals have committed even more crimes - over 700 more. Dozens of burglaries and thefts Threats to kill Drug dealing Even two rapes The next Conservative Government will scrap this tagging scheme, this mammoth insult to victims. I'm against early release in all but one case. There is only one early release that I will be prepared to see in the public interest. That's Jack Straw's early release from the chains of office - and Tony Blair and the rest of the Labour Party with him. And instead, we will introduce honesty in sentencing. With the complete abolition of automatic early release. Sentences will say what they mean and mean what they say. Discounts will have to be earned and will not be substantial - unlike now. Where a custodial sentence is passed, we will ensure that there is a programme of rehabilitation in place. Too many offenders who are sent to prison go on to re-offend. By ensuring that they have an alternative to a continuation of their life of crime, we can better protect the public. Idle prisons are breeding grounds for the disease of crime. We will move towards a full working day in all prisons, based on self-financing workshops that take on real work which real employers want in the real world. Prisoners' wages will go towards the cost of their upkeep, the support of their families, savings to give them a start when they leave prison, and reparations to the victims of crime. It is all about protecting the public. And we've got to start with the young criminals. We will take the young menaces off the streets, away from the environment that has failed them, and give them a real chance to change. Last year I set out proposals to do this, placing them in secure training and giving them a stable regime and a real chance to change. This year, I want to look beyond young criminals, at the single biggest cause of crime, particularly but not exclusively amongst the young. The single biggest cause of crime in this country today is drugs. Children are 20 per cent of our population but they are 100 per cent of our future. Drugs are the cancer that is eating away at our country and threatening those children and that future. It's not our children who are the only victims. Crime costs this country £50 billion a year - and at least a third of all crimes are drug related. 80 per cent of burglaries are motivated by drugs. One third of acquisitive crime is drug-related, costing victims over £2 billion a year. More than 100,000 people are convicted or cautioned for drug offences every year. Even if they end up in court, many get a conditional discharge or a small fine. Not exactly tough. What do the other parties offer? The Liberal Democrats toy with legalisation. And they want to end the tough mandatory sentences for drug dealers. In other words, give in. What they want to do is against all common sense. Labour promised a war against drugs. What have they done with the drug dealers? Given them the get out of jail free card. 23,000 criminals let out on special early release scheme, and more than 3,000 have been drug dealers or traffickers. Drug dealers who on average got 22 months' jail. Under Labour they served 9 months. So what will we do? We have already pledged tougher sentences for drug dealers who sell to our children and a crackdown on drugs in and around our schools. And, needless to say, we will scrap the get out of jail free card for 3,000 drug dealers. Today I am able to announce a new policy. Earlier this year, I visited New York, where under Mayor Giuliani crime has plummeted. Although we can't replicate exactly what I saw there, we can learn the lessons of tackling crime head on and not conceding a centimetre to the criminals. So today, I can announce a new policy. A policy that means no quarter for those whose trade is dealing in human misery, despair and even death. And so, from the possession of the most minimal amount of soft drugs right up the chain to the large importer, there will be no hiding place. There will be zero tolerance. Parents want it. Schools need it. Our future demands it. The next Conservative government will do it. What does it mean? It means zero tolerance of possession. No more getting away with just a caution, no more hoping that a blind eye will be turned. If someone possesses drugs, the minimum for a first offence will be a fixed penalty of £100. But not for a second offence. Then it's into court. And no more claiming that no matter what amount you've got on you, it's for personal use. Over and above the smallest amount, the charge will be substantial possession, and the penalties applicable will be of a range comparable to those for dealing. And as for the suppliers, we will put them out of business. We will dedicate police resources and police officers to identifying and cleaning up forever those houses and other places where regular supply takes place. And the replacement suppliers, and their replacements, and their replacements, until there are no more replacements. Yes, this will require extra money, yes this will require extra police officers, and yes they will be forthcoming. That will be money well spent. And there are other aspects of our drugs laws which we need to change. Why do you lose your licence for drink-driving, but not for drugs driving? In future, anybody caught driving with illegal substances in their bloodstream will be subject to a mandatory ban. Why should it be that you have illegal drugs in your pocket, you're guilty of possession, but when they're in your bloodstream, you're guilty of nothing? Why do we have laws against opium dens which don't apply to crack houses? Zero tolerance of the biggest scourge in our society today. That's what's going to happen on my watch. Other things will change also. Our asylum system will be completely overhauled and we will automatically house all new applicants in secure reception centres. It's extraordinary, but Labour call that racist. Yet the biggest loser in their system is the genuine refugee who comes to this country with not only a legal but a moral case for a safe haven, and finds himself clogged up in queue which has hit more than 100,000 cases - double what Labour inherited. If the message goes out to those who simply seek to play our system that in future they will be detained, dealt with speedily and removed, they will cease to come and we will be able to process the genuine applicant more quickly. However, for the real refugee, reception centres will provide a one-stop point of expertise in education for the children, language support, and social services support. At the moment such people, with all their vulnerability and needs are turned out to take their chance in areas where the local authorities have no experience in coping and where the provision of such services is a hit and miss affair. Let me make clear to Tony Blair what I believe - what is my 'irreducible core'. If you're asking me to stand by and see the genuine refugee stuck in a queue with tens of thousands of other applications; If you're asking me to tolerate a situation where that man waits months or years for a decision on his case while Ministers dither and officials shuffle paper; If you're asking me to put up with a shambolic system of support which is letting down both the refugees and the local councils and the local people who have to pick up the pieces, then vote for the other man, because I won't do it. Letting down genuine refugees. I don't think I could do that. Could you? Releasing 23,000 prisoners extra-early. I don't think I could do that. Could you? Cut police numbers when crime is rising. I don't think I could that. Could you? Surrender to the drugs menace. We couldn't do that. We shouldn't do that. We won't do that."
"11","Tim Yeo"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-04,"This debate has shown which party is the true champion of the countryside. It's shown that Labour's claim that it represents rural Britain is utterly bogus. Last week John Prescott, the true voice of Labour, said supporters of the countryside had contorted faces. I suppose life looks different through the windows of two Jags. But John Prescott'll soon find out that insults like that simply mean that rural Britain will make sure that after the next election he'll be driving his own car and buying his own petrol. Maybe by then he'll be backing Michael Portillo's tax cuts. Let me introduce my team. Our spokesmen in both Houses. Jim Paice, Malcolm Moss and Hazel Byford. And our whips Geoffrey Clifton-Brown and Arthur Luke. Last year Tony Blair set out his vision of the countryside. A giant theme park, a rural version of Labour's Millennium Dome. Where the past is forgotten, traditions mean nothing, and the future is bleak. By contrast we believe in a living and working countryside. A countryside for all the people. For us the survival of farming is part of Believing in Britain. Without farming the rural economy will decline. Without farming our green and pleasant land will fall into decay. We will never let that happen. When I finish I want you all to come with me to our Country Fair, just outside the Conference Hall. To demonstrate our support for the countryside. Our belief in a sustainable agricultural industry. Because sustainability is the key to the future. As the world's population grows, as living standards rise, how do we leave our children and grandchildren a better planet than the one we inherited? How do we stop using resources selfishly for ourselves alone? These are the questions we must answer. The questions Labour is ignoring. But before we can achieve our long-term vision short term problems must be tackled. And as speakers have pointed out this morning these problems have not just been neglected by Labour. They have been made worse by Labour. When nice Nick Brown took over from Junket Jack Cunningham there was a sigh of relief. Nice Mr Brown went round appearing to listen to farmers. The trouble is that's all he did. At last week's Labour conference he talked about shipbuilding. About coal mining. About the steel industry. But he didn't once mention dairy farmers, or pig farmers. That's why he isn't fit to be Minster of Agriculture. He's not nice Nick any longer. He's Nasty Nick. And if the Cabinet were in Big Brother. Nasty Nick would be thrown out first. Unless of course Chatshow Charlie Kennedy was one of the other contestants. For him, and for the rest of Chatshow Charlie's barmy army, the ones who were here in Bournemouth two weeks ago, politics is just another chatshow where the audience is bored with getting the same answer to every question. Whatever the question, Charlie's answer is a tax increase. More tax on income. More tax on petrol. You name it, they'll tax it. But let's give credit where it's due. The Lib Dems say they want to help the countryside. And they've certainly thought up some new ideas. Like getting rid of the Queen. Like promoting gay marriages. Like setting up an asteroid task force. They're really in touch. So closely in touch their agriculture spokesman says, ""overall it would be churlish to say [Nick Brown] hasn't been pretty successful."" The truth is Nick Brown has been disastrous. Disastrous for dairy farmers whose income under Labour has fallen by 70 per cent. Disastrous for cereal farmers whose income under Labour has fallen by 75 per cent. Disastrous for pig farmers whose income under Labour has disappeared altogether. Last year sixty people left farming every day. Gordon Brown boasts of ending boom and bust. But in the countryside he's started bust and bust. And all Nasty Nick offers is a sticking plaster for an industry that's bleeding to death. To make matters worse they're strangling farmers and small businesses with red tape. Burying them under a mountain of paperwork. Forcing small abattoirs to close. Applying regulations more toughly here than elsewhere. Regulations like a Nitrates Directive which hardly any other country enforces. An Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, which was never intended to apply to farming at all. I give you this promise. When William Hague is Prime Minister and I am Minister of Agriculture we won't enforce European rules any faster than France, than Spain, not even than Italy. And we'll do our damnedest to stop any more needless regulation from being introduced in the first place. But it isn't only Nick Brown's actions which damage farmers, consumers and the countryside. It's his inaction too. Take beef exports. Last year Labour claimed they'd ended the export ban. Even though they hadn't ended their own ban on beef on the bone. France didn't agree. They illegally blocked the export of safe British beef. In response Nick Brown did nothing. As the crisis got worse he stopped speaking to his French counterpart. At the Anglo French summit British beef wasn't on the agenda or the menu. Instead of confronting France Nick Brown sat cringing in Whitehall. And today, fourteen months after Tony Blair boasted that the beef export ban was over, exports are less than one per cent of what they were. Is that what Tony means when he says, ""by playing by the rules it is possible to win in Europe""? Sadly it isn't only beef farmers Labour has betrayed. Pig farmers have also been condemned - often to bankruptcy. Pig farmers who rear their pigs more humanely than many farmers abroad; who pay for extra health measures because of BSE, a problem they did not cause. Labour doesn't care how much bacon or ham or pork is imported from countries with lower health and animal welfare standards. Other farmers have suffered, too. Dairy farmers like Graham Bigwood, the Somerset tenant farmer, who is with us today. Two weeks ago I had a letter from Graham. He said: ""We have now reached the sad stage of talking to the Crown Commissioners about our future. We are a year behind on our rent and our debts are steadily rising. ""Yesterday I spoke to the Tenant Farmer's Association who advised me to try and negotiate a package with the Crown to leave Binham Farm. For the last twenty five years I have worked for eighty plus hours a week in dairy and face financial ruin as a result of this crisis."" In March Graham invited me to his farm where I helped milk his cows at five in the morning. He invited Nick Brown, too. But Nick didn't go. He didn't want to talk about Tony Blair's cave in last year on milk quotas or about how he smashed up Milk Marque. And Labour's damaged other farmers too. Sheep farmers have been betrayed because Labour feeds the army South American mutton rather than good British lamb. Arable farmers, like those in Tony Blair's own constituency, who I'm visiting next month, have been betrayed by Labour's refusal to claim agri-monetary compensation. Hill farmers have been betrayed by Labour's skewing of the rules to hurt the most vulnerable. Horticulture farmers are burdened with Labour's bogus Energy Tax, which we will repeal. Fruit growers like one I visited in Kent who had to leave fields of fruit to rot because Labour won't let him employ the people he needs to pick his crops. You'd think Tony Blair wants to put Britain's farmers out of business. And if that's the case Nasty Nick's the right man for the job. It's a scandal that Britain's rural communities are being destroyed. And it's a scandal that Labour is letting down consumers too. In March when Parliament debated a Conservative Bill requiring labels to say where food comes from and how it's produced, a Labour Minister deliberately talked it out. Tony Blair is too scared of what Brussels might say if Britain stood up for honesty in food labelling even to let Parliament debate the subject. So consumers continue to buy food labelled British even if the ingredients were grown abroad. This is a fraud on consumers. A fraud which Labour refuse to stop. A fraud we will end. A fraud made worse because Nick Brown's too weak to stop sub-standard food entering Britain. Like the poultry produced in the Far East using growth-promoting drugs banned in Europe on health grounds. Last year the European Commission found some French livestock was fed on human sewage. But when I demanded that British consumers should be protected Nick Brown did nothing. Is there a single person in this hall who believes that if it had been British farmers feeding their animals human sewage, Labour would not have cracked down? But when it's a French farmer Nick Brown's the farmer's friend. The Minister who lets British consumers eat sub-standard food - as long as it's produced abroad. The Minister who lets British farmers be destroyed by unfair competition. But it isn't only farmers and consumers that Labour is betraying. It's the environment, too. Labour's shambolic handling of GM crop trials threatens the integrity of organic and conventional farmers alike. And they're rushing ahead with commercial planting regardless of the effect on wildlife. In July I launched our policy document ""A Fair Deal for Farmers"". At its heart is our belief that the job of farmers is producing high quality food for British consumers. As well as looking after our rural environment. ""A Fair Deal for Farmers"" is full of positive ideas. Common sense ideas. Deliverable ideas. A retirement scheme for tenant farmers, like those Philip Cochrane and I met two weeks ago in Stafford, the seat Philip will represent in the next Parliament. A common standard for organic food so consumers know that items labelled organic mean what they say wherever they come from. Planning guidance to make it easier to reuse old farm buildings for new small businesses. These policies will be introduced in the first months of the next Conservative government. Along with lower fuel taxes so country people can afford to use their cars. Honesty in labelling so mums and dads know what they're giving the kids. Less red tape so farmers can get on with what they're good at instead of filling in forms in triplicate. An end to substandard imports so we can trust all the food we eat. So competition is free and fair instead of being loaded against British producers. ""A Fair Deal for Farmers"" also sets out our commitment to sweeping reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which has failed consumers, failed taxpayers, failed farmers, and failed the environment. Farm policy must move more towards the market. But it must also reflect the unique nature of the industry and its impact on the environment. If agriculture declines the fabric of our countryside is damaged, wildlife suffers, and the rural economy gets weaker. So I've got a message for Tony Blair. Instead of banning hunting he should be tackling the real issues. Instead of raising fuel taxes he should be helping rural business. Instead of building all over the green fields he should be protecting the environment. Instead of shutting down the post offices he should be breathing life into villages. Instead of stripping the countryside of policemen he should be tackling rural crime. Instead of introducing the right to roam he should be defending private property. But Labour have had their chance. And they've squandered it. And the last few weeks have shown voters know that too. The seeds of Tony Blair's downfall have been sown in rural communities up and down the land. A winter crop which will yield a rich harvest. A harvest of new Conservative MPs. Who understand farming. Who care for the countryside. When the election comes rural Britain will deliver a damning verdict on Labour and its Liberal Democrat lackeys. Because they're fed up with all the broken promises. Fed up with the arrogance and the lies and the spin. Fed up with a Government that says it's listening but goes on lecturing. Fed up with Ministers who preach to us about the environment as they cruise in their chauffeur driven gas-guzzling limos. Fed up with the highest fuel taxes in Europe, with queues at the pumps and buses that are cancelled. Fed up with a Government that let's terrorist murderers out of jail but wants to imprison people who go hunting. Fed up with the billions wasted on spin-doctors salaries and Dome bail outs while pennies are denied to disabled people and pensioners. Fed up with a Government that is soft on crime cuts the police force. Fed up with a Government that says taxes are going down when we all know they are going up. So whether it takes eighteen days, or eighteen weeks, or eighteen months. With your help this Conservative Opposition is going to drive Tony and his cronies out of Downing Street and save Britain's countryside before it's too late."
"12","Francis Maude"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-04,"Speakers today have all shown that they believe in Britain, they believe our country can be best in world. You all do; so do my team: Richard Spring and Cheryl Gillan in the Commons, who carve up the world between them. Stephen Day, our unsleeping Whip. Patricia Rawlings, who does terrific work in the Lords, and a special welcome, leading our Front Bench team in the Lords, to David Howell. It's wonderful to have David back in the front line. I'm a very lucky chap to have such an experienced and talented team. We're all part of one team. William's team. We're ready to govern. And I tell you: we're raring to go. Ten years ago I served as one of Margaret Thatcher`s Foreign Office Ministers. Quite a year, that was: the Berlin Wall came down; the Cold War ended, and the shape of the world changed. I don`t want to take all the credit. But in the ten years since then the world has changed out of all recognition. It's actually less stable than it was; the Cold War lent a grim predictability to life. Ours is a swirling, tempestuous world; a world bursting with opportunity; a world of lightning information flows. Truly a network world. People travel more; they know more about the world. Twenty or thirty years ago a trip round Europe was pretty exciting. Today it's like a trip across town. Today young people in their gap years can span the world - and they do. And they want to make a difference in the world - themselves - they don't think it's all down to governments. If we believe in ourselves, Britain can flourish in this new network world. Just look at the assets we have. The world's fourth largest economy. The second biggest overseas investor. The greatest international financial centre. English, the language of the internet, and of global exchange. Armed Forces admired throughout the world. Membership of the EU. At the heart of NATO. The transatlantic relationship. At the centre of the Commonwealth - and our new Commonwealth Commission is mapping out a big new role for it in the network world. In this new world, we aren't on the edge of anything. Britain can be at the centre of it all. Our foreign policy must be for this new world. We have to look outwards, not inwards. And it shouldn't be difficult. The British were globalists before the word was invented. We're committed to global free trade by 2020. That's the best hope for developing nations. Britain never has sought isolation. It never should. And under the Conservatives it never will. So yes, Britain can be at the centre of the new network world. We will use that position to serve British interests. We'll do so honourably and - yes - ethically. Talking of ethics: did you hear Robin Cook last week, going on about 'a miserable, shrivelled and shrunken thing'? Up and down the land, people were saying 'there he goes, talking about himself again. For him, ethics might just as well be a county east of London. There'd be a big change, said Robin Cook. Britain's foreign policy would have an ethical dimension. Who does this man think he is? This country, that spread freedom, law and democracy across the globe. That twice last century fought for all Europe against tyranny. That most recently helped liberate millions of our fellow Europeans from the iron hand of Communism. Where was Robin Cook when we were fighting that battle? Posturing in his CND badge. While we never let up, he wanted Britain to slink, weaponless, from the world stage. Foreign policy is about strength. Strength and honour. We`ll use Britain's strength in the world. We'll use it for peace and stability: whether in Kashmir, or Cyprus or the Middle East. We pray today that those caught up in conflagration in Gaza and the West Bank see that peace, not conflict, is the prize. We sincerely hope that the talks in Paris bring this violence to an end. We'll use our strength to promote democracy and the rule of law. The verdict of the ballot box must be respected. Mugabe and Milosevic: it's over. You tried to rig it - and you failed. Give up - and get out. And - yes - we`ll use British strength to promote the interests of Britain - and Britons. For we believe in Britain. It isn't obsolete. In the new network world, nations will matter more, not less. Globalisation means people need to be able to identify with their country more, not less. Last week I was in the Caucasus. I was meeting people who only regained their nationhood eight years ago. They're not about to give it up. Go to Kosovo, and talk to people, as I did: nationhood is their dream. And it makes sense: in this fast-moving world, governments need to be flexible, and responsive. Countries, today more than ever, need the power to govern themselves. And I just don't understand why Tony Blair's given up on it. He claims we either give up more and more powers. Or we condemn Britain to a lonely isolation. What a sad, outdated, defeatist view. Where's the vision? Where's the leadership? Where's the conviction? All round Europe, there is a really serious debate about its future. We agree with some bits, disagree with others, but it's a real debate, with real convictions. There's only one leader with nothing serious to say. Tony Blair. No leadership, no vision. It's different behind closed doors. He'd happily take Britain into a European superstate. He'd love to scrap the pound. But he wants to do it by stealth. It's the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name. He knows that most people, the mainstream majority, want no truck with it. The mainstream majority want to be in Europe, not run by Europe. That's why last year, against all expectations - perhaps even against our own - we won the European elections. The winners, under Edward's leadership, have been hard at work. We work together - one team. In the last few days they've tabled the largest number of amendments to the European budget anyone can remember, aimed at cutting waste and eradicating Euro-propaganda. There's still a lot to sort out. The Commission needed a man of sharp intellect, decisive action and few words to put their house in order. They chose Neil Kinnock. Why do I think there's still some distance to go? Well. Here's a pointer. The day I was in Brussels last month, Labour MEPs drove through a directive on…how to climb a ladder. That's right - there really is an EU way to climb a ladder. It says this: 'Ladders shall be so positioned as to ensure their stability during use.' 'Mobile ladders shall be immobilised before any person steps onto them.' Well, thank you. Then they agonised over whether to permit 'The holding of a ladder by another person as a safety measure.' And there let us leave them, these Labour MEPs: up their ladders; off their trolleys. You really couldn't make it up, could you? Tony Blair says we do make it up. He says it's all fantasy. 'No one I know wants some overblown United States of Europe', he says. Really? You know the German foreign minister, don't you, Mr Blair? He wants 'the transition … to … a European Federation.' 'We must put into place the last brick in the building of European integration, namely political integration', he said. You know Mr Prodi too, don't you? Didn't you appoint him? 'Step by step … the European Commission … behaves like a growing government', he says - and he means it, too - he approves of it. And you must have met the French Prime Minister? He claims he's met you, anyway. He talks of the EU crossing 'a milestone towards the creation of a united political Europe'. We may not like what they're saying. But at least they're honest. Why can't Tony Blair tell the truth? Why can't he be honest? So let me be clear. If some others decide to integrate more, we won't stand in their way. That's their sovereign right. But a Conservative government will not - not - do the same. And no, we won't be 'left behind', or 'isolated'; we're not missing any boats. Two simple things came out of last Thursday's Danish pasting. No more one size fits all. And nothing inevitable about scrapping the pound. People want to be in Europe but keep the pound. They know they can. And with a Conservative government, they will. For the mainstream majority agrees with us. They're not anti-European - and nor are we. If we weren't committed to stay in Europe, why bother trying to change it? And the first change is that for Britain, integration has gone far enough. We will oppose any further loss of the British veto over EU laws. We will oppose the job-destroying Charter of Rights. And we will oppose the creation of an EU defence force outside NATO. It's so clear now that the public agree with us that I suspect Tony Blair may be getting a bit fussed. So don't be deceived if he tries to water down the Nice Treaty this December. He hasn't suddenly seen the light. He knows there's another treaty in the pipeline. A treaty to create a European constitution for a European superstate. A treaty planned for - yes, after the next election. That's why the stakes are so high: that's why we've really just got to win. Today I make two commitments. We will legislate so that further transfers of power can only take place after a referendum. Yes, Mr Blair: the people. Remember them? And we are all fed up with seeing the European Court extending the EU into areas of national government well beyond those that Parliament intended to transfer. So we will legislate to create 'reserved powers'. Beyond the powers we intended to transfer, EU law will not override the will of Parliament. Never again will the Treaties be extended by un-elected EU judges. We're not going to break our treaty obligations. There is no question of that. We honour Britain's obligations. But why shouldn't Britain enjoy the same constitutional protection as France, Germany and Italy already do? If it's good enough for them, it should be good enough for us. Next, we'll insist on a flexibility clause; outside the single market and core areas, let countries be free to accept only those new Euro-laws which meet their needs. And let's be blunt: some Brussels policies just aren't working. The aid programme. The Common Agricultural Policy. The Common Fisheries Policy. They all waste money - they're failing relics. They don't need to be run from the centre. More can, and more should, be run by the nation states. It's eleven years since that momentous November night when the Berlin Wall came tumbling down, and the Iron Curtain was shattered. The EU has a historic duty to embrace the whole family of European nations. It's taking far too long. If we want enlargement - and we do - we need a flexible Europe, a network Europe. We not going to take lectures from those who were nowhere to be seen while the West won the Cold War and made enlargement possible. Mr Chairman, Europe's strength is the diversity of its nation states. It's their very sense of nationhood. This is the basis for our vision of Europe, a flexible and enlarged European Union. It's the vision for which Conservatives have long argued, under Margaret Thatcher and John Major and William Hague. For us believing in Britain isn't just a phrase. It's what we're about. Yes, we believe in this United Kingdom - we believe it really can be the best place in the world. Yes, we believe in Britain, because we believe in the British people. Today people know more; they want to do more - themselves - not just for themselves, or by themselves; but together, and for others. For others not just here at home, but abroad too. You see, like us they don't think it's all down to Governments. They're sceptical about politicians, even suspicious; they just don't believe today that the answer is ever higher taxes and an ever bigger state. They long for leaders who are honest with them, who respect their intelligence. They long for a party that is in tune with their hopes and fears, for themselves and for their country. They long for a Government that earns their respect by speaking the truth. We are such a party and, under William Hague, we will be such a Government. And if we hold fast to our beliefs and fight for them with every sinew, we will not just win the chance to serve. We will be worthy of it."
"13","David Heathcoat-Amory"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-04,"It is a great privilege to take over the Trade and Industry job from Angela Browning who has done so much to expose the myth that New Labour helps business, or even understands it. And I'm very lucky to have a team like Alan Duncan, Nick Gibb and Richard Page, as well as Doreen Miller, Peta Buscombe and John Mackay in the Lords. Each of them on their own knows more about Trade and Industry than the entire Labour front bench put together. One of the puzzles about the DTI is this: How is it that after all the privatisations, all the industries freed from state controls, all the competition we brought in, the DTI has gone on growing? After 3 years of a Labour government its running costs have increased by £114 million. This year alone it will take on an extra 500 civil servants. So as the DTI's responsibilities get smaller, the department gets bigger. So don't tell me that there aren't savings to be made in public expenditure without hitting front line services like health and education. Pledge number one: The drive for a smaller state starts here. The DTI will be reorganised to make it leaner, fitter, and smaller. And instead of policies from New Labour we get gimmicks. Last year Stephen Byers announced that he had discovered 'Rip off Britain'. The consumer he said was being 'treated unfairly'. What he didn't say was that it's his government that's doing the ripping off. Who made our road fuel the most expensive in Europe? A body blow to the haulage industry and every manufacturing company in Britain. The Labour government did that. Petrol is now taxed more heavily than champagne. The champagne socialists are now the ones with a full tank of petrol. And it's not over yet. From next April every business in the country, from the smallest corner shop to the biggest multinational, will pay a new energy tax, the so-called Climate Change Levy, on all their gas and electricity bills. So yes, Britain is being ripped off, by the Treasury with its stealth taxes. And you Stephen Byers have done absolutely nothing to stand up for either the consumer or British business. For that failure, Mr Byers, amongst so many others - it is time you went. You've done nothing for small business either. Look at sub-post offices - small business which are being chopped off by this government and are now closing in record numbers. The only reaction from this government is to talk of setting up some Universal Bank, which is so universal it's invisible. This destruction of the post office network will not be forgotten at election time. It's not just taxes. As any businessman will tell you, there's the endless regulations, red tape, and government interference. And the inexhaustible stream of European Union directives. The government deliberately added to this torrent of regulation by giving away, unilaterally, our hard-won opt out from the European Social Chapter. That was an act of political vandalism that's costing British business an extra £10 billion in this Parliament. Labour Ministers and MPs have no idea what it's like to be on the receiving end of hostile taxes and regulations. I do, and I'm going to do something about it. But let's admit that we didn't do enough when we were in government. We checked the regulatory juggernaut but we failed to reverse it. But now we've listened to businesses, particularly smaller ones who haven't the time to serve on consultation committees in London but who end up bearing the costs. We've listened and we're going to act. We will independently calculate the total cost of regulations issued by each government department. And that total will have to come down year by year. William Hague has made clear that ministerial careers will depend on it. So we've all been warned. The message is, we're serious. It adds up to pledge number two: I will de-regulate before breakfast, before lunch and before tea. The DTI under us will be a department for deregulation. One more point before we start our debate. There are huge opportunities for this country from the electronic revolution, the internet and e-commerce. These technologies are outward looking, tariff-busting, distance-conquering, and they all use the English language. They are not just liberating technologies themselves; they also reinforce Britain's position and history as a global trader. Sometimes I'm accused of being a Little Englander because I'm against joining the euro. The truth is the exact opposite. It's the Labour party who are the Little Englanders, they are so defeatist about our nation that they will try and lock us into a continental system of high tariffs, high taxes, high regulations, and the euro. We have a bolder vision: yes to free trade, no to the euro. British industry needs world markets, and a country which is confident, self-governing and free. That is our policy. That is exactly what we will deliver."
"14","Damian Green"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-05,"The blue-green agendaWe've already broken new ground in this debate by giving the pressure groups direct access to our conference. Let's be even braver. I will now pause my speech, so you can hear every new idea Tony Blair has had about the environment this year. Well that didn't take long. That's how much he cares. Next time he cocks his head in that really sincere pose, remember that he cares as much about the future of our planet as he does about Mo Mowlam's career prospects. But John Prescott, who told us he hates the Countryside Alliance so much, does have a policy. It's to pour a million tons of concrete over our greenfields . Like Baldrick, he has a cunning plan. He is going to get rid of the Countryside Alliance - by getting rid of the countryside. So let's send him a clear message. This Party will fight with all its energy to save the precious gift that has been handed down to us: the British countryside. And we will fight for our Green Belt, our urban parks, our village greens. We will fight, and we will win, Mr Prescott, because we have the biggest block vote of all behind us on this—The British people. You can tell this Government knows nothing about the countryside when you look at their legislation. The Countryside Bill contains good proposals for protecting wildlife and natural habitats. We support those parts of it. But what we don't accept is the way the Government has framed the so-called Right To Roam part of the Bill. It has been devised in the spirit not of loving the land but of hating the landowner—especially the farmer. We want to take out the parts that will damage wildlife, like unrestricted night-time access—a potential burglar's charter. Let me tell the Government today - we will support you when you propose genuine wildlife protection measures - but we will oppose you at every stage when you threaten our wildlife, our quiet spaces and the traditions of our countryside. On the environment, we also have to deal with the Lib Dems--.if only because they constantly tell us how green they are. In a spirit of helpfulness, to save anyone else the trouble—I have read Charles Kennedy's Book. Well, I may have skimmed the odd page, or chapter. He says on page 75, quote - ""I am used to people asking me 'what are your policies on the environment ?' - I always find it difficult to answer."" I'm not surprised. He devotes a whole chapter of his book called The Future Of Politics - dream on Charlie - to warm words about the environment. So perhaps he can explain the behaviour of LibDem Councils. Like Eastleigh - just up the road. This LibDem council had to choose one out six possible sites for a housing development. They chose the one that involved building a road right through a Site of Special Scientific Interest. And to compound the crime, it's an area that contains a species in danger of extinction; the southern damselfly. So, as ever with the LibDems, don't listen to what they say, watch what they do. If you do nothing else for the environment next year kick out a LibDem Council and reduce the amount of noxious hot air released in your locality. So we know that our Conservative 'Blue Green' Agenda is the only serious policy that will preserve our green fields, protect our wildlife, and enhance our air quality. Why? Because for us protecting the environment is not an add-on or an afterthought. Every Conservative wants to act as a trustee, preserving the best of what we have and enhancing it for future generations. We believe in Britain. We want to make this country the best place to live. Indeed a Conservative government invented the Department of the Environment. It was originally going to be called 'the Department for Living'. But as its first boss, Peter Walker points out, that would have made him Secretary of State for Life - and for some reason, his colleagues weren't keen. And we Conservatives stick to our core beliefs when we look at the environment. We don't become a high-tax, high-interference party as a route to becoming a green one. We will use tax carrots not sticks to encourage individuals to make green choices. Not least when they drive—to answer that point from the pressure groups. We believe in giving more power to local decision makers; because local communities are the most passionate defenders of their green spaces, whether in the inner-cities, the suburbs or the countryside. We are one nation in that passion. We heard another serious challenge from the green pressure groups. The global threat of climate change. Labour's approach has been typical. A new tax, introduced incompetently. The Climate Change Levy will do nothing to stop Climate Change, it will clobber British business, and an incoming Conservative Government will scrap it immediately. Instead, we have been listening—genuinely listening. We have brought together the leading figures from the Renewable Energies Industry, and asked them how this country can become less reliant on fossil fuels that pollute the air. Today I am unveiling the first fruits of this process. A Conservative Government will set ambitious targets for using renewable energy; solar power, off-shore wind, energy crops, even wave power. We will look at a huge range of ideas. Why shouldn't houses or businesses that generate their own power from solar panels be able to sell that power to the grid at a decent price ? Why don't we encourage off-shore wind power? - We have the technology, and anyone who lives by the sea knows we have the wind. This Government is letting Britain fall behind on these new technologies. We will fight climate change with new technology not new taxation. William Hague's Conservative Government - coming soon - will lead the way in making Britain the key player in this vital growth industry of the 21st Century. So we will tackle the big global green issues. But we also believe that sustainability begins at home. That's why we have a recycling policy that is significantly greener and more radical than any other party's. Conservatives have always said 'Trust the People.' I think we can trust them to be green, if we offer them the chance. So we will offer everyone free recycling collections from their doorstep. Labour offers hundreds of new incinerators across the countryside. I know the British people will prefer our solution. When they leave home, we should offer them streets that are clean and swept, free of abandoned cars and not covered in obscene and racist graffiti. That is why we say local councils should be able to keep the revenue from fines on litterbugs, or on those who dump their old cars on the roadside. I pledge to this Conference - a Conservative Government will keep our fields green, our streets clean, and our air pure. Cleaning up after New Labour will be a tough challenge. But throughout its history the Conservative Party has never shied away from tough challenges, and we will not do so now. And so to our immediate challenge: let's make sure that the next time this conference meets, it is to acclaim the election of a new Conservative Government."
"15","William Hague"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-05,"This has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years. This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government. And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government. This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country. And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain. The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too. Didn't Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he'll be?The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent. After years of Robin Cook wouldn't it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude?The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government.The breadth of vision to win the war against crime; and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe. Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future. Labour's looked like a Conference from the past. After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week. Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer. I like it without the sandwiches. Come to think of it, I like it without the unions.And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election.Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister we now know when that election is planned to be. Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour's disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six month's time? John Prescott innocently replied: 'no it hasn't'.But even without John Prescott helping us out, we're ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it. We're ready for it next autumn, we're ready for it next May, we're ready for it now. Go on Tony, call it now.We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover. Don't even bother they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever.But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion. And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that's out of fashion.We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are - this soap opera of a government.In last week's episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter. Peter won't talk to Geoffrey any more. Geoffrey won't lend his holiday home to Tony. Mo has been sent to Coventry. Clare doesn't like the tent run by Tony's crony. Tony's crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon. Peter won't speak to Gordon. And Gordon won't speak to anyone at all.Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back.No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them.When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it.When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she ""had a little cottage in the country"".Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol.It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country. And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country.And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - It's you that I'm in it for.For all the people who can't afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money - I'm in it for you.For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court - I'm in it for you.For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it - I'm in it for you.For all the people who think it's a scandal when a patient's throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets - I'm in it for you.For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you.For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so - I'm in it for you.For all the people who believe that we shouldn't be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country - I'm in it for you.For all the people who want to keep the Pound - I'm in it for you.For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people - we are all in it for you.For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed - we are in it for you.These are people who look to us to give them back their country. And we will not let them down.When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people.Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century. Last week, nine months into the twenty first century, he didn't mention the forces of Conservatism at all.We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head.But just because he's stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn't made us go away. Just because he's paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn't mean we're not out to get him.Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people.You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour? Midnight. December 31st last year. You probably all had a good time on New Year's Eve. Ffion and I, we went to the Dome.What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? 'I'm absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success … it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000'. Well he wasn't wrong about that. And then there was John Prescott: 'if we can't make the Dome work, we're not much of a Government'. Whatever would we do without him?Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be 'the first paragraph of Labour's next Election Manifesto'. What a good idea. In fact such a good idea that I thought I'd help him out by drafting it for him: 'Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years'.There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government.For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome. It is that the Prime Minister who now admits that Governments can't run visitor attractions still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone's money. You've seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill. That is New Labour. That's what they're doing to our schools. That's what they're doing to our hospitals. That's what they're doing to our police force. With the Dome it's taken nine months to see that these interfering busy bodies didn't know what they were doing. Don't give them five more years to prove that they don't know what they're doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police.Peter Mandelson said recently: something's gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it? Shall we tell him?Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world. Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000. Secondary school class sizes are bigger. Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling. The transport system is at a standstill. Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe. Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic. The bureaucracy is bloated. Political correctness is rampant. The countryside is in crisis. The cities are neglected. Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it. That's what's wrong with this Government.Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction. I said: 'New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being. Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with. Then admiration. But next it will bring disillusion. Finally it will bring contempt'. We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt. In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again: 'I will act'. Well, of course he will. It's all been an act. It's only ever been an act. He's the biggest actor in town.But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos: 'TB' - a clever disguise - 'is not believed to be real. He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.'TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice. WH could have told him it for nothing.The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals. But of course we've witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too. Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance.So people now look to us. They've seen through the Labour Party and its Leader. Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver.This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be. They look to us. They want to know if we're ready. They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office. They want to know where we come from and where we're going to.And they want to know what motivates me.Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire. See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in. Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life. Come and meet the people I grew up with. Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next. Those children I grew up with have families of their own now. Many are better off than their parents. They own their own home and they're saving for a pension. Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they're nurses and teachers and self-employed builders. And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job.But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did. They want security and stability for themselves and their families. They want a better life for their own children. Don't think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don't have aspirations for a better life.Don't think that because they've moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored.The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country. They are the people who motivate me. And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them. For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won't stretch any further. They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it's like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark. They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British.These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me. And these are the people we will govern for. We will govern for hard working families. We will govern for people of every community and background. We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored. We will govern for all the people. For when New Labour say to us that we're only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard working families of this country.I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government.You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be.You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will.You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know.The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS.And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government.There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and mutual respect for all people, and championing the mainstream values of the country.There is no contradiction. I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things. I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country. Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering.That's why we're going to lead a Common Sense Revolution.That's why we're going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us.We're going to govern for the families who've earned every penny they've got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes.Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn't seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments, don't you just love 'em?Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn't give in to pickets. What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamans' strike and encouraged the miner's strike and supported the secondary pickets.If he'd really been listening, he'd never have introduced his stealth taxes and he'd never have had blockades and he'd never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers' revolt. Well if they don't understand the taxpayers revolt, we do. If he's not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won't cut taxes, we will. This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy.Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn't being greedy.He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he'd scraped together disappear in stealth taxes. And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he's living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him.Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn't being greedy.He just can't understand how this country can ever succeed if he's being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly.And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him.Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The countless hard working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren't being greedy. They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all.And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side - and we will govern for them. All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.We know what we're going to do for them.We're going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel.We're going to restore a married couples allowance - because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society.We're going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families.And we know how we're going to pay for it too.We're going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it.We're going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must work.We're going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair.We're going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall so that there aren't so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else's lives.Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn't be more wrong. People don't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours.The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done.And we're going to do it.For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education.Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me - ""There's a grammar school nearby, why didn't you visit that?""And I said ""I've visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven't got a grammar school to choose from.""So I've been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers.I've been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves:parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them;teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers;head-teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools.It's time someone listened to these people. The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them.All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.We know what we're going to do for them.We're going to take the money that's spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. £540 for every pupil.We're going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world.We're going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy. We're going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we're going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it's going to stop.The British people know these things can be done.And we're going to do them.For we're ready to govern for all the people.We're going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country.The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple.Pensioners don't like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all ""racists"".They don't like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they're not worth bothering with because they're not 'aspirational'. I reject this language. Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect.And they don't like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means tested benefits and one off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best.Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them.All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.We know what we're going to do for them.We're going to take Gordon Brown's gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. £5.50 more a week for every pensioner; £10 for an older pensioner couple.We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision.We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians.We're going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension.The British people know these things can be done.And we're going to do them.For we're ready to govern for all the people.We're going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.It's time we halted the march of political correctness. Can you believe that Birmingham's Labour Council decided to rename Christmas 'the Winterval'?Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression?Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television?I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we're going to govern for them.I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don't want Section 28 abolished to know that we're going to govern for them.I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules - I want them to know that we're going to govern for them. But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime.Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago. We got around a table in their classroom, and do you know what they said to me? 'The police have got their hands tied and they've lost it. Crime is rising and we're most likely to be the victims'.These people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.We know what we're going to do for them.We're going to restore Labour's cuts in our police force. And we're going to stop tying their hands with red tape and politically correct nonsense. We're going to have less PC and more PCs.We're going to have no more of Labour's early release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers.We're going to overhaul the law to make sure that it is on the side of the people defending their homes instead of the criminals breaking into those homes. We're going to step up the war against drugs, not surrender to the drug dealers. We're going to make sure that prisoners don't idle around in their cells but do a full working day.We are going to give full force to the common sense instincts of the British people and we're going to win the war against crime. The British people know these things can be done.And we're going to do it.For we're ready to govern for all the people.And we're ready to govern for all parts of the country.Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of EnglandI saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren't enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit warrens for crime. It's the same story in many of our cities.The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them.We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves.We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside.Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside.This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life - and we will not let them down. For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all.For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate.Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century. We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth. Our language is the global language of the new economy.It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British. And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too. The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics. In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken. It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe.Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe. A Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents.We will be the champions of that flexible Europe. And we will be the champions of Britain's right to govern itself. For we believe in being in Europe not run by Europe.So we will write into the law of our land the powers and rights that we hold today and which we will pass to the next generation, so that no stroke of a pen from Brussels, or retrospective court judgement, can take those rights away.And we will champion the common sense instincts of young people who know that the idea of creating artificial, centralised supra-national superstates is an idea left behind in the twentieth century as they plan their lives in the twenty-first.They too believe passionately that we should be making the most of being British. So I say to them, whatever else you might have thought about the Conservative Party and what we've done for Britain, it is only by coming with us that you can make sure that there will still be a Britain.Making the most of being British means that if taxes are lower in Britain than elsewhere in Europe we should be making them lower still to ensure that we keep our competitive advantages.Making the most of being British means that if our regulations are lighter than in Europe they should be lighter still for British businesses.And making the most of being British means that if other countries give up their currencies and take on the job of applying one set of rules to every economy across Europe, we should say: good luck, we wish them well, but we will keep our Pound.At the coming election, we will be the only Party committed to keeping the Pound, just as we will be the only Party committed to common sense on the countryside and on our inner cities, on crime, on education, on pensions, on health and on tax.As we approach this election, conscious of our responsibility to provide a new government, clear in our principles for which only we can stand, resolved in our purpose to serve the people of our country, we know who we are and what we promise to be.I don't promise the earth.I don't think we'll solve every problem.I don't think we'll avoid every mistake.I won't try to start new fads or fashions.I won't claim to be creating a new era.I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people of this country.I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a proud people who believe in Britain.In place of squandered opportunity and high taxation, the determination to seize the opportunity of a new economy.In place of dogmatic interference and Whitehall knows best, the certain belief in the freedom of people to make their own choices about their schools and hospitals.In place of political correctness and the noise of the pressure group, the quiet trust in the tolerance and mutual respect of the British people.In place of fear on our streets and the menace of drugs, the absolute conviction that the war against crime can be won.In place of the cringeing surrender of our rights as a country, the confident assertion of our right to be a nation.I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a people that believes in Britain and its values and institutions.I just want to bring to a people so deeply disillusioned by its Government,A Party that understands their concerns.A Party that shares their values.A Government that believes in our country.A Conservative Government, ready to govern for all the people."
"16","Nigel Waterson"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-05,"Reducing the power of central governmentI would like to thank the whole Shadow DETR team for their support on local government issues, but in particular my colleague Tim Loughton for his unstinting work on the Local Government Bill and on regional matters. I would like to pay tribute to you Chairman for all your dedicated work for the Party and for local government, and in particular for your distinguished service as our Leader on the LGA. In turn, I would like to welcome Cllr. Gordon Keymer to this key role. But most of all I pay tribute to all of you - councillors and council candidates - for your constancy in difficult times; and your sheer guts, determination and hard work which have restored us firmly to being the second party of local government, and will soon restore us to being the first. I wish you all well in the battles which lie ahead. The main battle will be against this Government's centralising, interfering, and patronising attitude to local democracy. Of course we can all agree that local government faces problems, not least the often very low turnouts. But Labour's answer to the problem is more centralisation and taking more powers and more choices away from locally elected councillors. And perhaps we can't really blame them when you see what Labour (and Liberal Democrat) local government gets up to! It was Labour controlled Birmingham Council which decided to re-brand Christmas - as 'Winterval' - because they felt Christmas was offensive to religious and ethnic minorities. Or Lib Dem controlled Colchester which outlawed Punch & Judy - on the grounds that it promoted domestic violence. Labour Education Minister, Margaret Hodge, endorsed the proposal to ban the children's game of musical chairs - because they said it encouraged aggression. And were you as angry as I was to read that Labour-controlled Durham County Council decided to change the name of the Durham Light Infantry Museum to the DLI Museum - DLI standing for 'discover, learn and innovate'. Or when the Environment Agency tried to blocked the placing of a plaque to commemorate the 'little ships' of Dunkirk, because they didn't want to mention the war. And then one of the best examples of 'politically correct' attitudes from this Government - Section 28. Last week in Brighton, Local Government Minister Hilary Armstrong described the scrapping of Section 28 as 'unfinished business'. How arrogant and out of touch can this Government get? The plain fact is that our Conservative opposition to repealing Section 28 is supported by the common sense majority of people in this country including most parents and religious leaders. Once again, the Conservative Party have spoken up for the common sense instincts of the British people. Tony Blair told the British people last week that he was listening. Well Tony - the trick is not just to listen, but to do something about it. By contrast, we have listened, we have learned, and we have devised new policies which will deliver a modern forward-looking local government, well able to meet the challenges of the 21st Century. Too much interference from the centre has weakened local government and undermined the ability of local communities to develop local solutions to local problems. That is why we have opposed with vigour the parts of the Local Government Bill imposing unwanted new structures. And we were not alone in fighting this legislation. Many Labour councillors shared our concerns. No doubt those smaller shire districts who benefit from the eleventh hour climbdown by the Government on structures will be relieved. But it does make a total nonsense of the Act. If it's alright for small councils - why not large councils too? Nor should we ever forget the role of the Liberal Democrats in this episode. They were the ones who struck a grubby deal with the Government to ensure that the compulsory new structures got through the House of Lords. On this as on so much else, they really are Labour's lackeys! And we have stood up too for parish councils - often the Cinderellas of local government. Thanks to our energetic defence of them, the Govt has backed off plans to replace them with so-called ""neighbourhood forums"". So let me make our position absolutely clear. We believe in parish councils. We do not want to see their role undermined or diminished. Under a Conservative government there will always be a role for parish councils. One of the gravest threats to local democracy under this government is their regional agenda. That is why we will abolish Regional Development Agencies and regional assemblies. They have no part to play in a properly accountable local government structure. We are sick and tired of John Prescott's cronies sitting on these bodies and parroting the Labour agenda. And Labour have said that county councils will be abolished to make way for regional government. The last thing we need is another reorganisation of local government. By contrast, we believe responsibility for enterprise and economic development should be handed back to local government - where it belongs. We will cut other bureaucracy too - such as the Best Value regime. We do not oppose the principle - after all, we pioneered CCT - changing the whole culture of local government. But what has ruined Best Value is this government's over-prescriptive approach - with many councils facing 160 or more separate performance indicators. The inspection culture is costing an estimated £600 million a year. No wonder there is a projected national shortage - of auditors! In short, it is expensive madness, and we shall review the whole working of Best Value when we regain office. And that is not all. We propose the most radical shake-up in the planning regime for 50 years. How many of you serve on your local planning committee, and are told by the officers on controversial applications that if you turn it down the developers will appeal, the Council will lose and it will be very costly? How often do you wonder what the point is of having a local planning committee? How often do the local people you represent feel they have no real say in the existing planning system? We mean to change all that. We think the country deserves a 21st century planning system which is sensitive to local needs and devolves power to local communities. We will end national housebuilding targets. Residents will be fully involved in drawing up plans for their locality. We will allow local councils to decide on the future development in their area - after all they are best placed to do so. For the first time, local residents will have a right of counter appeal against planning decisions. And we will have a streamlined appeals procedure, ending the role of the Secretary of State. No longer will he have the power to impose unsuitable new development on a local community. Nor is that all. The next Conservative Government will not cap local authorities. We will trust local government. It should be for the local electorate to punish incompetent or spendthrift councils - not ministers or civil servants. And I can announce today our firm pledge that the next Conservative government will give back to local councils the choice over their structures. Those who have adopted the cabinet system, and find it suits their needs, they are welcome to keep it. But those who prefer a committee-based system can have it too. In addition, we will scrap Labour's regulations for increased secrecy in local government. Conservatives have always believed - local councils should be open and accountable to the people they serve. But we will go even further. We announced in ""Believing in Britain"" that we will establish ""Free Councils"". · There will be new freedoms to raise capital and issue bonds for large projects. · New freedoms from red tape and bureaucracy. · New freedoms to set their own spending priorities, not the government's. · New freedoms to spend receipts from council house sales, working in partnership with the voluntary and private sector. Any council will be able to become a Free Council - provided they have a viable business plan, they are financially efficient, and have healthy levels of democratic participation. Because local autonomy must be underpinned by local accountability. Fellow Conservatives, The sooner Tony Blair calls the Election the better. We shall be ready for it whenever it comes. But we do know for sure that we have the county council elections in May. We will all be fighting hard for control of every single county council in the land. And with the spirit here in this Hall today, I know we can do it!"
"17","Archie Norman"," Party Conference Speech 2000",2000-10-05,"Making Britain a Better Place To LiveThree wasted years… 1253 days of a Labour Government. Of decline of our cities and loss of greenfields. Disillusion and despair is their legacy and Britain cannot wait for change. That is the challenge that our opposition team is ready to meet. To meet the challenge of Standstill Britain - Bernard Jenkin, supported by Shadow Roads Minister, Robert Syms. To meet the challenge of over centralisation - Nigel Waterson and Bill Dixon Smith. To deliver for the environment, the author of famous pamphlets - including some very good ones on our new Blue-Green environmental policies, Damian Green. Responsible for revitalising our cities and abolishing regional bureaucracy, Tim Loughton. And the man who keeps us in touch - and occasionally in order - our Whip, Peter Atkinson. I commend them to you and I commend them to the country, because This is a team that believes in Britain. Our task is to make Britain a better place to live. Good Government is not just about pounds and pennies it is about the quality of life. When Labour came to power They promised to decentralise and revitalise local Government. They promised to reduce homelessness. They promised to be the first ""truly green Government."" And to do all this they had the best opportunity for a generation and they have squandered that opportunity. Instead of decentralising they have centralised. Instead of restoring our cities they have perpetuated the decline. They used to parade as the Party of local government. Instead Labour have taken the culture of interference and the nanny state to new heights. They dictate how Councils should meet; They bombard them with plans and forms to fill in; They force them to build houses on the countryside; They create armies of Inspectors and box ticking auditors; They have impoverished our farmers and buried them in red tape. They pay lip service to devolution but they are the most centralising Government ever. In a few months time this country will face a choice. Between our team and theirs. It is for you to judge our credentials. I cannot pretend I have John Prescott's qualifications. I have not spent 30 years in politics waging class war. I have not spent a lifetime as a career trade unionist and politician. I do not dislike people who work in business or live in the countryside. Instead I have 23 years of business experience. And I am here today to do what I believe is right for my Party and right for my country. But don't judge Mr Prescott by what I say Judge him by what he says. As you know he said: ""The greenbelt is a Labour achievement and we mean to build on it"". He meant it - and he is doing it! He said: ""I will have failed if in five years time there are not ….. far fewer journeys by car"". He meant it - and three weeks ago he nearly did it! He said of the Dome: ""if we can't make this work, we're not much of a Government"". He meant it. And it's true! They ain't much of a Government. I am not quite sure what he meant when stepping off a plane from one of his many trips abroad when he said: ""I am glad to be back on Terra Cotta"" But …….. he probably meant that too! So our challenge when in Government is clear. We will undo all the damage John Prescott has done. We will roll back the power of the central state. We will break forever the culture of control from Whitehall To let local people decide on local issues. That is why our policies are based on two simple principles: 1. Firstly, we believe in people and communities making their own choices. So we will restore power to local Government and local people. 2. Secondly, we believe that whatever their background people should have an equal right to a safe home, a tranquil neighbourhood and a decent education. So on Monday we launched dynamic new policies to end deprivation in our cities. Margaret Thatcher and Michael Heseltine started it. We will finish it. Breaking the culture of centralisation is not something that comes naturally to Governments. So the changes we make will be far-reaching - not just cosmetic. - We will give local councils new powers to promote economic development and we will end rate capping. - We will restore to councils the right to decide for themselves structures they adopt and how they meet. - We will abolish once and for all every vestige of regionalism, regional assemblies, RDAs and their Committees packed with Labour cronies and their £70mn of bureaucracy. Believing in Britain is about Believing in local government. We know that there are many councils with strong democratic support, well run and delivering services for their people. Yet why should these councils suffer the same burden of regulation and inspection as the Labour rotten boroughs of the North? Why should Hampshire and Kent, Wandsworth and Westminster pay the price of corruption in Doncaster or mismanagement in Leeds and Liverpool? That is why we will give the best councils independence from regulation and control and we will guarantee their funding. They will be citadels of independence. They will be 'free councils'. We know that we will not reverse the culture of centralisation unless we fracture it forever. And that means trusting local people. But there is a greater challenge. The challenge of making Britain a better place to live. The challenge of rebuilding our cities and protecting our countryside. Of ending forever the vicious circle of migration from our towns and the relentless destruction of green fields. If we care about the future of our country If we care about the way in which our children and our grandchildren will live we cannot tolerate a situation where - Education results in our cities are often three times as worse than in the suburbs. - Crime has soared in almost every major city in the North and Midlands and rose by 12% in London alone last year. - While at the same time in 3 years we have lost 20,000 acres of our countryside to the bulldozers. These are the facts that shame a Government that came to power promising to govern for the many, not the few. For all Britain's prosperity For all the growth in incomes For all the growth in tax Fewer social houses have been built under Labour. Homelessness has risen under Labour - there are now 3000 more homeless people. Less money has been spent on regeneration under Labour. And the North/South divide has grown under Labour. They are hell bent on a policy of building on the countryside, extending urban sprawl, and destroying villages and small towns. Four million new houses in the next 20 years. 900,000 in the South East, the most congested part of Britain. 410,000 in the South West including in Devon two new towns on world class countryside. Quite simply, the wrong houses in the wrong places. That's why under the next Conservative Government - no longer will the DPM come down from Hull and force unwanted houses on the villages of Kent. - And we will scrap the national house building targets. We will give the power to decide how many houses are built to local councils. There was a time when England was a country of towns and villages of local character. Wherever you arrived you knew where you were. - the flint of Norfolk - the honey-coloured stones of the Cotswolds - the red sandstone and cobbles of the North West Where local people cherished and encouraged their unique local buildings and local architecture. But under John Prescott England is becoming a country of uniformity, of identikit houses - the same in Kent as in Norfolk, - the same in the Cotswolds as in Cumbria. We will give local councils the power to specify local architecture and building materials. And not just on architecture. We will give them the power - to control the siting of mobile phone masts. - to take action on the small things that blight people's lives - such as litter, graffiti and dumped cars. Protecting our countryside is vital for the whole nation. The death of our countryside is also the death of the inner city. For every family leaving the city for a new house in the countryside There is a declining school roll in the city There is a small shop closing in the city There are empty houses and rising crime in the city. So that in so many deprived areas the greatest ambition of the more able hard working families…. is to leave the city. After three wasted years of a Labour Government the message for families in our inner city estates is….. If you want to get a job - you have to get out! If you want to get educated - you have to get out! If you want your children to walk home from school in safety - you have to get out! That is why if we are to be a compassionate Government. If we are to be a Government committed to all our people then we must also be a Government committed to reversing the flight from our cities. They tell me regeneration requires patience. Well Britain can be patient no longer with a Government that ploughs £900mn into the Dome and pretends it's something to do with regeneration. With a system that ploughs money into fancy buildings for politicians to open while leaving the streets unsafe to walk and families locked behind fortress housing. That is why our regeneration companies will bring new money into our schools and policing. We will make crime reduction and good schools the foundation steps of regeneration. Britain can be patient no longer while different Government departments pursue criss-crossing, ill-co-ordinated initiatives in different cities. So under the Conservatives we will roll out powerful new regeneration companies co-ordinated by a single 'regeneration' Minister. Able to bring in private capital. To help new schools and put more police on the beat. And Britain can be patient no longer with a system that allows streets of decent, honest citizens to be blighted by a small minority of bad neighbours, failing to pay the rent and desecrating the neighbourhood. So we will bring in new powers To penalise and ultimately to evict, those who live rent free at the taxpayers expense and make life hell for those around them. Our challenge is to make the inner cities, once again, places people want to live in, not to flee from. We should be ambitious for our cities. Residential cities, where families want to live, to go to school and to work. So that Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham and Manchester rank alongside the great cities of Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen, This is the Government of Whitehall and the metropolitan elite. They talk of decentralisation but are the most centralising ever. They talk of being green but they are engaged in relentless destruction of our countryside. They talk of tackling homelessness and deprivation but have betrayed their heartlands and increased poverty. Our task is to bring back ambition to all our people. It is to continue a great Conservative tradition. From Disraeli, to Margaret Thatcher and John Major and now William Hague. To say to all our people, no matter where you were born, no matter what your background You are equally valued. You too have a part to play. You too can succeed. And if you come with us we will provide that opportunity. Because we know that believing in people is better than believing in Whitehall. We believe in our communities and neighbourhoods. We believe in the future of our cities. And the protection of our countryside. Quite simply, We believe in Britain."
